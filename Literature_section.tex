\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:work}

Research on this topic spans three main areas: methods for extracting sentiment and entity-level opinions from text, work on sentiment and perception of NBA players, and studies on how popularity and recognition affect economic outcomes in sports.

\subsection{Sentiment and entity-level opinion mining}

Early sentiment analysis work treated polarity detection as a supervised text classification problem on relatively clean review data. Pang et al.\ showed that machine-learning models trained on labeled reviews can substantially outperform simple rule-based baselines, motivating the use of statistical models rather than only hand-crafted lexicons for sentiment classification~\cite{pang2002thumbs}. However, such approaches were originally developed for well-formed texts and do not directly address the noisy, informal language typical for social media and online forums.

For social media, Hutto and Gilbert proposed VADER, a rule-based sentiment model specifically tuned to short, informal messages~\cite{hutto2014vader}. VADER combines a polarity lexicon with heuristics for punctuation, capitalization, degree modifiers and emoticons, making it suitable for platforms such as Twitter or Reddit where users frequently rely on non-standard spelling and symbols. In the present project, VADER provides a lightweight and interpretable baseline for scoring the sentiment of basketball-related posts.

More recent work in NLP has adopted transformer architectures for text encoding and sentiment classification. Models such as BERT use self-attention to build contextual token representations and have become state of the art on many text classification benchmarks, including sentiment analysis. A fine-tuned transformer can capture subtle contextual cues (e.g., negation, comparisons between players) that lexicon-based models may miss, which is attractive when modelling nuanced fan discussions about contracts and free agency.

Because fans and journalists often mention multiple players and teams in the same message, the project also relies on Named Entity Recognition (NER) to attribute sentiment to specific players. Neural NER architectures, such as the BiLSTM–CRF model of Lample et al., combine word and character information to robustly identify person and organization names in noisy text~\cite{lample2016ner}. Using such a model allows the system to identify NBA player mentions in Reddit posts and news articles and to aggregate sentiment at the player level over the pre-signing window.

\subsection{Sentiment and perception of NBA players}

A small but growing literature uses social-media sentiment to study perceptions of NBA players. Li et al.\ collect Twitter messages mentioning individual players and apply sentiment analysis to derive player-level features, which are then used alongside performance statistics to predict player performance metrics~\cite{li2021nba-sentiment}. Their results indicate that sentiment contributes additional predictive power beyond historical statistics alone, suggesting that crowd opinions capture information that is not fully reflected in box-score metrics. This work is close in spirit to the current project in that it links fan sentiment about specific players to quantitative outcomes, but the outcome of interest is on-court performance rather than contract size or overpayment.

Other work has examined NBA sentiment on Reddit in a more descriptive way. Tummala analyzes fan discussions on basketball subreddits, extracting sentiment and topics to compare how different players are perceived over time~\cite{tummala2023reddit-nba}. This study demonstrates that Reddit provides a rich source of spontaneously expressed fan opinion and that off-the-shelf sentiment analysis can reveal interesting patterns in how players are discussed. However, it does not connect these patterns to economic variables such as salaries or contract decisions, nor does it adjust for player performance.

Taken together, these studies show that fan sentiment towards NBA players can be measured from social media and can be predictive of some outcomes, but they do not address whether pre-signing sentiment is associated with players receiving contracts above the level suggested by their past performance.

\subsection{Popularity, reputation, and economic value in sports}

A separate line of research in sports economics investigates how non-performance factors such as reputation, status and popularity influence salaries. Ertug and Castellucci model NBA player salaries using both performance measures and proxies for reputation and status, such as awards and All-Star selections~\cite{ertug2013reputation}. They find that, even after controlling for on-court productivity, reputation and status have a significant positive effect on pay, suggesting that teams reward not only efficiency but also perceived star power.

More recent work has focused explicitly on social-media presence. Kloc et al.\ define a ``media value'' for NBA players based on follower counts and engagement on platforms such as Twitter and Facebook, and show that this value is strongly related to both contract size and endorsement income~\cite{kloc2020socialmedia-nba}. Applied analyses in the sports analytics community likewise report that players with larger Twitter followings tend to command higher salaries, even when basic performance indicators are taken into account~\cite{stice2020athlete-branding}. Similar effects have been documented in football, where players with high brand value and media exposure attract higher transfer fees than equally productive but less visible peers~\cite{valentini2020brandvalue-football}. These findings collectively support the idea that teams pay a premium for marketable players who attract attention and engagement from fans.

The present project builds on these strands of work. From NLP and sentiment analysis, it adopts tools to extract player-level sentiment from noisy text. From NBA-specific sentiment studies, it takes the insight that fan opinions can be quantified at scale. From sports economics, it takes the hypothesis that popularity and reputation are priced into contracts. The main gap in the existing literature is that prior work typically uses coarse popularity proxies (awards, follower counts) or focuses on performance prediction; to our knowledge, no study has yet used text-derived fan and media sentiment in the pre-free-agency window to model performance-adjusted NBA contract value. Here, the goal is not to establish causality but to test to what extent pre-signing sentiment is associated with contract ``overpayment'' after controlling for past performance.
% \section{Introduction}
% \label{sec:intro}
% This document serves as an example only, and delivered ``as is" with no claims of completeness or correctness. The text is all more or less filler text, but may contain some information tidbits that you find useful. 

% When writing your paper, you replace this text with your own text. It is important to keep in mind that the section headings are \emph{example} headings only, and you should change them to meet your needs.

% \section{Related Work}
% \label{sec:work}
% After the introduction comes the related work. As a sanity check: Think about which already existing paper is most closely related to yours. Be sure to cite that paper. Include a statement of whether you are applying the approach of this paper, or whether you are innovating beyond this paper. There may be more than one closest paper. 

% Note the difference in indentation. The first line of the first paragraph of a section is not indented. The first line of the second paragraph of a section is indented. 

% \section{Approach}
% \label{sec:approach}
% A well-written approach section will explain both \emph{why} design decisions were made and also \emph{how} they were implemented.
% Remember: You want to maximize the reproducibility of your paper.
% This means, that it should be possible for other authors to pick up your paper, and recreate the experiments that you did, and achieve the same results that you also achieved.

% \subsection{About Sub-sections}
% The titles of your sections and sub-sections should be informative: your reader wants to be able to glance at your paper and understand what can be found where.
% However, they also should not be too long. It's best if section and sub-section titles are short enough to fit on one line.

% \subsection{More on Sub-sections}
% A section should either have no sub-sections, or it should have more than one sub-section. A section with only one sub-section is unbalanced, and leaves your reader asking why that one sub-section is necessary.

% \subsubsection{About Sub-sub-sections}
% Of course the option of including sub-sub-sections is also available. The same rule holds. A sub-section should either have no sub-sub-sections, or it should have more than one sub-sub-section.

% \subsubsection{More on Sub-sub-sections}
% We advise you to avoid using sub-sub-sections. They take up space, and may be confusing rather than helpful for your reader. Use your own judgement.

% \section{Results and Analysis}
% Please report your results in your paper.
% However, in addition to the quantitative results, it is also very important that you include a discussion of the qualitative insight that you gained.

% You can carry out, for example, a failure analysis: inspect key examples, and try to arrive at a generalization of the source of the shortcomings of your algorithm. It is not necessary to use exactly the same sections here, but we include them as examples.

% \subsection{Formatting Information}
% This sub-section contains a list of issues that you should think about when writing your paper.
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Use short and simple sentences. When it doubt, express a thought in two short sentences, rather than one long one.
% \item Please spell check and grammar check your paper.
% \item Please check for widows and orphans. In other words, look for cases in which a section title or a single word is stranded at the bottom of a page or at the top of the next page. Wikipedia gives more information about widows and orphans.
% \item Please don't use .bibtex directly from the Web without reading it. Instead, go through your .bibtex carefully and make sure that your references are both complete and consistent. 
% \end{itemize}

% Do not end a section with a list or with a table. Good style demands that a section includes a final sentence which ties the content of the list or table back to what is being discussed in the text.

% \subsection{Other Information}
% We take this opportunity to remind you that any paragraph you write should consist of more than one sentence. Paragraphs should always contain, like this one does, at least two sentences.
% %\footnote{This is a footnote}  

% ACM tells us, ``You can use whatever symbols, accented characters, or non-English
% characters you need anywhere in your document; you can find a complete
% list of what is available in the \textit{\LaTeX\ User's Guide}
% \cite{Lamport:LaTeX}." In the following section, there is more information from the original ACM version of this sample file.

% \section{Even More Information}

% \subsection{Math Equations}
% A formula that appears in the running text is called an
% inline or in-text formula.  It is produced by the
% \textbf{math} environment, which can be
% invoked with the usual \texttt{{\char'134}begin\,\ldots{\char'134}end}
% construction or with the short form \texttt{\$\,\ldots\$}. You
% can use any of the symbols and structures,
% from $\alpha$ to $\omega$, available in
% \LaTeX~\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}; this section will simply show a
% few examples of in-text equations in context. Notice how
% this equation:
% \begin{math}
%   \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0
% \end{math},
% set here in in-line math style, looks slightly different when
% set in display style.  (See next section).

% A numbered display equation---one set off by vertical space from the
% text and centered horizontally---is produced by the \textbf{equation}
% environment.  Again, in either environment, you can use any of the symbols
% and structures available in \LaTeX\@; this section will just
% give a couple of examples of display equations in context.
% First, consider the equation, shown as an inline equation above:
% \begin{equation}
%   \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0
% \end{equation}
% Notice how it is formatted somewhat differently in
% the \textbf{displaymath}
% environment.  

% \subsection{Tables}
% We include Table~\ref{tab:freq} so that you have an example of a table.
% \begin{table}
%   \caption{Frequency of Special Characters}
%   \label{tab:freq}
%   \begin{tabular}{ccl}
%     \toprule
%     Non-English or Math&Frequency&Comments\\
%     \midrule
%     \O & 1 in 1,000& Nothing here\\
%     $\pi$ & 1 in 5& Common in math\\
%     \$ & 4 in 5 & Used in business\\
%     $\Psi^2_1$ & 1 in 40,000& Unexplained usage\\
%   \bottomrule
% \end{tabular}
% \end{table}
% To set a wider table, which takes up the whole width of the page's
% live area, use the environment \textbf{table*} to enclose the table's
% contents and the table caption. 

% %\begin{table*}
% %  \caption{Some Typical Commands}
% %  \label{tab:commands}
% %  \begin{tabular}{ccl}
% %    \toprule
% %    Command &A Number & Comments\\
% %    \midrule
% %    \texttt{{\char'134}author} & 100& Author \\
% %    \texttt{{\char'134}table}& 300 & For tables\\
% %    \texttt{{\char'134}table*}& 400& For wider tables\\
% %    \bottomrule
% %  \end{tabular}
% %\end{table*}
% %% end the environment with {table*}, NOTE not {table}!


% \subsection{Figures}

% No sample paper would be complete without a graphic illustrating a fly. We have commented out the code to insert graphics, but you can see it if you look at the source. 

% %\begin{figure}
% %\includegraphics{fly}
% %\caption{A sample black and white graphic.}
% %\end{figure}

% %\begin{figure}
% %\includegraphics[height=1in, width=1in]{fly}
% %\caption{A sample black and white graphic
% %that has been resized with the \texttt{includegraphics} command.}
% %\end{figure}


% As was the case with tables, you may want a figure that spans two
% columns.  To do this, and still to ensure proper ``floating''
% placement of tables, use the environment \textbf{figure*} to enclose
% the figure and its caption.  And don't forget to end the environment
% with \textbf{figure*}, not \textbf{figure}!

% %\begin{figure*}
% %\includegraphics{flies}
% %\caption{A sample black and white graphic
% %that needs to span two columns of text.}
% %\end{figure*}
% %
% %
% %\begin{figure}
% %\includegraphics[height=1in, width=1in]{rosette}
% %\caption{A sample black and white graphic that has
% %been resized with the \texttt{includegraphics} command.}
% %\end{figure}

% \section{Discussion and Outlook}
% Remember: Sometimes the most interesting results are actually negative results.
% Please think carefully about those aspects of your approach that did not work as you expected.
% Even if you are disappointed by these aspects, the lessons you learned may be valuable for other researchers moving forward.
% Please describe them here, focusing on what you feel are the most valuable points.
