He's quite literally one of the worst offensive players in the NBA but defensively there's something there and the kid has truly dynamic speed. But with the addition of Harper... Good luck. Trying to find minutes in that Spurs back court moving forward. Fox, harper, Castle is too much talent and potential \n\nMalachi is a confusing one. He had a fringe ceal case for all rookie second team his rookie year. He showed real self-creating three level scoring potential... And he's just absolutely hit a wall ever since. His defenses atrocious and he can really be insanely inconsistent on the offensive end.. \n\nBut if the wizards need a young guy to put up some shots he can definitely do that for them",

    "selftext": "Preemptive disclaimers: no I’m not a fan, yes he’s salty, yes he did underperform somewhat. \n\nAll of that out of the way: it gets way too much attention and the bigger determinant was not his individual play but the fact that his prime (‘01-‘07) was marred by having zero help in the first half (‘01-‘04, the Orlando portion), and some help but almost zero depth in the second (‘04-‘07, in a stacked conference no less). \n\nYou can go through each series up to ‘07 and find he had the supporting cast disadvantage in every single one, was the best player on either team in 2 of the 5 (‘03 against the Pistons, ‘05 against the Mavs in a series featuring Prime Dirk, Yao and Jason Terry) and at worst the second best in two others (Bucks in ‘01, Hornets in ‘02). \n\nThe only series he really screwed the pooch (yes, ‘03 is exempted) was ‘07. \n\nAcross this stretch of time, Mac averaged 30-7-6-1-1 on slightly above league average efficiency in the playoffs. His numbers compared favourably to Paul Pierce’s, whose prime as a #1 option coincided perfectly with T-Macs (‘01-‘07) in both the regular season *and* the playoffs. \n\nOnce you zoom in you find pretty clearly that none of his teams aside from maybe the ‘07 one (big stretch) were realistic contenders. \n\nAll things considered, I can cop to him underperforming by sporting an 0-fer in his prime. Even if the odds weren’t favourable in any one series, he had five opportunities and could’ve defied them a time or two. But that’s really what we’re talking about here: the difference between 0 playoff wins and 1-2. None of his squads were actually good, even the ‘05 Rockets (yes, they had Yao, but their 3-9 slots were one of the worst in the league), and here were their regular season with-and-without-Tmac’s:\n\n01-02: 43-33 in games he played, 1-5 when he sat.\n\n02-03: 38-36 with, 3-4 without.\n\n03-04: 19-48 with, 2-13 without.\n\n04-05: 49-29 with, 2-2 without.\n\n05-06: 27-20 with, 7-28 without. \n\n06-07: 50-21 with, 2-9 without.\n\nAfter that, his body fell apart and his time as a truly great player was all but done. \n\n\nFor anyone that disagrees with the premise, please let me know which specific statement was wrong. Insults and ridicule are fine (“sticks and stones” and so on) but tell me where I’ve erred, and how. ",

This is why I think CP3 has always improved teams despite being 6’0 even once he became an old man. \n\nThere was a lot going against TMac.

    "title": "The Scott Foster Giga Post (is \"The Extender\" an earned nickname?)",
    "selftext": "# Introduction\n\nThere's a lot of misinformation surrounding Scott Foster, which bothers me. Not because I love Scott Foster, but because I don't like when people say things that are wrong. I spent some time compiling (real) information, and wanted to share it with others who may also be curious but don't have the time or ability to do it themselves. I'll go over two main things in this post:\n\n1. The details surrounding Foster and Donaghy's phone calls \n2. Comprehensive data behind Foster's nickname, \"The Extender\", specifically,\n\t1. Do teams trailing in the series often win while Foster is officiating?\n\t2. Does Foster call fewer fouls against teams who are trailing in the series?\n\nThere's nothing in Part 1 that hasn't already been said, but I still see a lot of misinformation about it. Most of the post will be about part 2, which is almost entirely original work.\n\n----\n# Part 1: How suspicious should we be of Foster and Donaghy's phone calls?\n\nNot very.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFor background, between December 2006 and April 2007, Tim Donaghy and Scott Foster had over 100 phone calls (either 134 or 170, depending on which period of time and which source you refer to) between them, many of them 2 minutes or less. This was during a time period in which Tim Donaghy was illegally gambling (or providing picks, more accurately) on NBA games, some of which he officiated. Sounds bad!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhat's Foster's explanation for this? That referees are often alone while traveling. They call each other frequently to shoot the breeze while they wait for shuttles, sit in airports, or kill time at hotels before games. Foster and Donaghy are the same age, they both officiated summer league games together in the early 90s, they were both hired by the league at the same time for the 1994-95 season, and so they became friends.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBut obviously we shouldn't just take Foster's word for this. Fortunately, we don't have to. Foster was investigated twice. Once by the FBI, and once by an independent firm hired by the NBA. They both came to the conclusion that there was no evidence suggesting Foster was involved in the gambling scandal.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNow, you might be thinking to yourself, \"so the NBA investigated itself and found no wrongdoing? Yeah, no shit.\"\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBut the NBA did not investigate itself. They hired the law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen, & Katz to do the investigation. The team of attorneys was led by [Larry Pedowitz](https://www.wlrk.com/attorney/lbpedowitz/), a former federal prosecutor who specializes in white collar investigations like this. (Perhaps you think they were hired and told not to look too hard. This seems unlikely; according to Larry, they were given basically unlimited access to NBA resources and told that if any of the referees did not fully comply, the referee would be terminated. I like to think that the guy whose career is based on doing these things wouldn't risk the legitimacy of his name or his firm's name.)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhile we don't have very many public details about the government investigation, we have all of the details of the private firm's investigation. The 14-month long investigation culminated in a 133 page report that they released to the public for free. You can read it [here](https://assets.espn.go.com/media/pdf/081002/PedowitzReport.pdf). But if you couldn't even make it to the 9th paragraph of Scott Foster's wikipedia page, you won't read this shit either. So let's walk through the reasoning, using details from the report.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### Why would friends call each other over 100 times (either 134 or 170, depending on which period of time and which source you refer to), mostly less than 2 minutes?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBecause what is being referred to as a \"phone call\" is not really a phone call, a lot of the time. The cell phone records have a couple of quirks  (page 30 & 31 of the report): \n\n1. Phone calls do not need to be answered in order to be recorded as a call.\n2. The minimum length a phone call can be recorded as is 1 minute\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThat means that if you call someone, let it ring once, and then immediately hang up, that is recorded as a one minute phone call. So if a phone call is under 2 minutes, it's likely that no one even picked up.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### That's still way too many calls, I don't buy it. He didn't call any other refs more than 13 times!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThat's a lie/misunderstanding that gets perpetuated. *Donaghy* reportedly did not call any other refs more than 13 times. Foster called plenty of other refs: (Page 33)\n\n\n#### Foster Phone Records (Dec 2006-Apr 2007):\n- 170 calls to Donaghy, 55% 2 minutes or less\n- 153 calls to Matt Boland, 51% 2 minutes or less\n- 75 calls to Mark Wunderlich, 53% 2 minutes or less\n- 32 calls to Danny Crawford\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAlso, the phone call patterns stay consistent even *after* Donaghy, Battista, and Martino (the two co-conspirators) went to jail:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n#### Foster Phone Records (Dec 2007-Apr 2008):\n- 156 calls to Boland\n- 55 calls to Crawford\n- 23 calls to Wunderlich\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe investigation also pulled phone records from Boland and Wunderlich during the same time period (Pages 34 & 35):\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#### Matt Boland Records  (Dec 2007 to Apr 2008):\n- 191 calls to Zarba\n- 156 calls to Foster\n- 24 calls to Kersey\n- Frequently before and after games\n- Almost half were 2 minutes or less\n\n&nbsp;\n\n#### Mark Wunderlich Records  (Dec 2007 to Apr 2008):\n- 191 calls to Crawford\n- 123 calls to Delaney\n- 86 calls to Salvatore\n- 23 calls to Foster\n- Frequently before and after games\n- About two-thirds were one or two minutes long\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe investigation team also interviewed every ref (who, once again, were told by the league that if they lied or failed to comply, they would be terminated.) According to the report (Page 34),\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>\"many of the referees to whom we spoke indicated that they thought that their calling patterns with fellow referees were similar to Foster’s and that their phone records would also show hundreds of short calls to fellow referees both before and after games. The referees explained that they often talk about basketball, sports and personal matters, so their cell phone talks resemble office water cooler conversations. A number of referees also said that their closest friends on the referee staff tend to be those with whom they entered the League ― with some analogizing that group to their “pledge class.”\"\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo either:\n\n1. The phone calling patterns are typical for most refs, OR\n2. Many of the ~70 refs in the league were in on it, and no evidence of this was ever found.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTo me, it seems pretty clear that the phone calls were not suspicious. However, not everyone finds this convincing. I'm not sure why. I've tried to ask, but people tend to stop replying after you ask them why they would continue to call each other 100s of times. While being investigated. *After* the people actually making the picks went to jail. Guy like me? I'd probably lay low for a bit. But maybe the action is the juice for those fellas.\n\n----\n## Part 2: Does Scott Foster deserve the nickname \"The Extender\"?\n\nThis one is interesting. I've seen a handful of different (sourceless) numbers, but it's hard to track down the actual data. Even Wikipedia has this except about it, with three citations attached:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>Nicknamed \"**Agent 48**\" and \"**The Extender**\", because teams trailing in a [playoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs \"NBA playoffs\") series have often won games he has officiated, thus lengthening the series, Foster's refereeing has drawn criticism from fans and players.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYet none of the three citations say *anything* about the record of trailing teams. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nBut there is some good work that has been done on this, see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1kv8g9d/scott_fosters_record_as_the_extender_since_2021/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1kzkrhj/the_extender_fallacy_an_analysis_into_the/).  I wanted to expand on these a little bit, both by using a larger dataset and by adding a few details. I have three different sets of data for this:\n\n1. Game outcomes from 2008 to 2025\n2. Individual foul calls from 2015 to 2025\n3. Last 2 minutes reports, also from 2015 to 2025\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWe'll start with the first data set, and gradually get more granular with the 2nd and 3rd datasets.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFor complete transparency about the numbers I'll be showing below, you can download the datasets I used [here](https://github.com/absolutelyZeroEQ/zeroEQ.github.io/tree/main/docs/data) on Github. If you'd like to double check my work after reading the sections below or follow along, you can see my annotated R code [here](https://absolutelyzeroeq.github.io/zeroEQ.github.io/foster_games.html) for details on how I summarized the game-level data and [here](https://absolutelyzeroeq.github.io/zeroEQ.github.io/foster_fouls.html) for details on how I summarized the foul-level data. If you notice any mistakes, let me know!\n\n\n----\n\n## 2.1 Do trailing teams \"often win\" games that Foster is officiating?\n\nFrom 2008 to 2025, Scott Foster officiated 230 games. Of those, 153 were games where one team was trailing in the series (what I call \"uneven\" games in the dataset). The record of the trailing team in these games was 71-82, for a 47% winning rate. I'll continue to refer to \"trailing\" and \"leading\" teams. Keep in mind that I'm talking about trailing or leading in the *series*, not leading in terms of points of a particular game.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIt seems like the trailing team does *not* often win when Foster is officiating, but we need to be more careful. Teams that are trailing *should* have a sub 50% win rate, because if a team is trailing, that means they're probably a worse team than the one they're playing. So we need to compare to non-Foster officiated games:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n| Officiated by Foster?| Trailing Wins | Trailing Losses | Trailing W% |\n| ------------------------ | ------------- | --------------- | ----------- |\n| No | 1143          | 1446            | 44%         |\n| Yes     | 72            | 81              | 47%         |\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHere we can see that trailing teams do have a slightly higher win rate when Foster is officiating, compared to games Foster is not officiating. There are two things to consider when looking at this table:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n1. This 47% rate is the 13th highest out of 38 refs with at least 20 \"uneven\" games officiated in this span. In other words, trailing teams have a higher win rate under 12 other refs.\n2. Scott Foster is a very experienced ref, which means he officiates a lot of games in later rounds.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe first point is important because, well, the nickname is THE Extender, not One Of The Fifteen-ish Extenders.\n\n&nbsp; \n\nThe second point is important because the first round includes 1-8 and 2-7 matchups, which should pull the win % of trailing teams down a lot. Since Foster officiates a lot of games in later rounds, that means teams are more evenly matched, and so we should expect the win % of trailing teams to be higher for him than for the typical ref. This seems obvious, but just to confirm this intuition from the data, we have that from 2008 to 2025:\n\n- Of the 10 refs with the MOST experience, 46% of their games occur in the first round\n- Of the 25 refs with the LEAST experience, 83% of their games occur in the first round\n\n&nbsp;\n\nScott Foster in particular had 41% of his games in the first round. Now let's split the data into Only Round 1 vs Excluding Round 1 to see if the winning %s are significantly different. Another point in favor of splitting the data like this is that some people feel that the \"juicier\" matchups occur later, giving more incentive to extend them.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### Round One Only\n\n| Officiated by Foster?| Trailing Wins | Trailing Losses | Trailing W% |\n| ------------------------ | ------------- | --------------- | ----------- |\n| No | 582           | 836             | 41%         |\n| Yes     | 27            | 38              | 42%         |\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis matches up with our hypothesis: teams trailing in round 1 have a much lower W% than in later rounds. Foster ranks 27th out of 44 refs with at least 10 \"uneven\" round 1 games officiated. (Note that we used a 20 game filter before, but a 10 game filter here--this will remain consistent for these subsets.)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### Round One Excluded\n\n| Officiated by Foster?| Trailing Wins | Trailing Losses | Trailing W% |\n| ------------------------ | ------------- | --------------- | ----------- |\n| No | 561           | 610             | 48%         |\n| Yes     | 45            | 43              | 51%         |\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhen we exclude round 1, we see the winning % of trailing teams is indeed much higher in later rounds. We also see that trailing teams still have a 3 percentage point higher win rate when Foster is officiating. Is this meaningful? I don't think so. Why?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWell, once again, Foster isn't even in the top 10 most egregious cases: out of 33 refs who have at least 10 \"uneven\" games officiated beyond the first round, Foster ranks 11th here in trailing W%. But I don't hear Monty McCutchen (24-22 record) called \"The Extender\". I don't see a flood of conspiracy posts when Kane Fitzgerald (10-9) is assigned. I don't even know what the fuck Tom Washington (15-14) looks like. Here's another way to think about how small this difference actually is:\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFirst, suppose Scott Foster really does try to extend series. Then, suppose that under a neutral ref, the \"true\" expected winning percentage of trailing teams (beyond the first round) is 48%. Under this neutral ref, we would expect trailing teams to have a record of 42-46 across 88 games. So across 17 years and nearly 100 games, \"The Extender\" has only managed to swing the outcome of 3 games beyond what we would expect.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOkay, but you may still have some gripes with this. One is that we're not accounting for blowouts--Foster can't reasonably swing a game that ends in a +32 scoring margin, after all. So let's check if that changes anything: (excuse the awkward table formatting. I did it this way initially and now I'm too lazy to change them.)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### Excluding Blowouts\n\n\n| Data subset       | Officiated by Foster? | Trailing Wins | Trailing Losses | Trailing W% | Ref Rank       |\n| ----------------- | ------------------------ | ------------- | --------------- | ----------- | -------------- |\n| All Rounds        | No | 953           | 1171            | 45%         |                |\n| All Rounds        | Yes     | 62            | 67              | 48%         | 14th out of 35 |\n|                   |                          |               |                 |             |                |\n| Round 1 ONLY      | No | 513           | 682             | 43%         |                |\n| Round 1 ONLY      | Yes    | 24            | 31              | 44%         | 21st out of 38 |\n|                   |                          |               |                 |             |                |\n| Excluding Round 1 | No | 440           | 489             | 47%         |                |\n| Excluding Round 1 | Yes     | 38            | 36              | 51%         | 9th out of 32  |\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBasically every conclusion is the same as before. The later rounds stick out *slightly* more, but once again, that's about a 3 win difference over expected.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis analysis is still a little primitive, though. Just because trailing teams don't win doesn't mean Foster wasn't *trying* to rig the game. This is where we introduce the second dataset.\n\n----\n\n## 2.2 Does Foster's whistle favor trailing teams?\n\nThis second data set only ranges from 2015-2025, but it has the advantage of including individual foul calls by each referee. Something to note: this dataset excludes transition take fouls, violations (e.g. kicked ball), certain turnovers (e.g., traveling calls), and techs. It's basically just personal and shooting fouls. It does not get rid of intentional fouls late in the game--more on this later. If Scott Foster is favoring teams that are trailing in the series, we should expect his percentage of calls against the leading team to be >50%.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### All Playoff Games\n\n| Called by Foster?| Calls against leading team | Calls against trailing team | % of calls against leading team |\n| --------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------- |\n| No | 11998                      | 12076                       | 49.8%                           |\n| Yes| 795                        | 795                         | 50%                             |\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNo, that's not a typo in the second row. If I was gonna fudge the data, I wouldn't be this blatant. Remarkably, Scott Foster has called the *exact same* amount of fouls against the trailing and leading teams from 2015 to 2025. In terms of % of calls against leading team, Foster ranks 21st out of 45 referees with at least 100 calls made. I.e., there are 20 referees that called a higher percentage of fouls against the team leading in the series.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nUnlike with the winning %, we shouldn't really expect foul calls to be that different in each round. But as mentioned before, some people may think only later rounds should be eligible for extending. Also, I don't want to be accused to cherrypicking or hiding results, so we'll include it for completeness.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n| Data subset       | Called by Foster?| Calls against leading team | Calls against trailing team | % of calls against leading team | Ref Rank       |\n| ----------------- | --------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------- |\n| Round 1 ONLY      | No | 6284                       | 6361                        | 49.7%                           |                |\n| Round 1 ONLY      | Yes          | 320                        | 348                         | 47.9%                           | 31st out of 43 |\n|                   |                 |                            |                             |                                 |                |\n| Excluding Round 1 | No | 5714                       | 5715                        | 50.0%                           |                |\n| Excluding Round 1 | Yes          | 475                        | 447                         | 51.5%                           | 9th out of 29  |\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWe said that if a ref favored the trailing team, we should see that call % to be >50%. Foster's is 51.5% if we exclude round 1. How meaningful is this? Well, Foster officiated 56 \"uneven\" games in this span. This comes out to an average of 8 calls per game against the trailing team and 8.5 calls per games against the leading team. One extra call every 2 games (on average) is a pretty small advantage. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nBut there are three refs assigned to each game. What if the other refs are picking up his slack? In other words, what if we look at the *total* calls made against trailing teams when Foster is crew chief, not just calls he personally made?\n\n----\n\n## 2.3 Does Scott Foster's entire *crew* favor trailing teams?\n\nI'll skip the bullshit here and just show the tables:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n| Data subset       | Officiated by Foster? | Calls against leading team | Calls against trailing team | % of calls against leading team |\n| ----------------- | --------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------- |\n| All Rounds        | No              | 9964                       | 10030                       | 49.83%                          |\n| All Rounds        | Yes             | 2034                       | 2046                        | 49.85%                          |\n|                   |                 |                            |                             |                                 |\n| Round 1 ONLY      | No              | 5437                       | 5521                        | 49.6%                           |\n| Round 1 ONLY      | Yes             | 847                        | 840                         | 50.2%                           |\n|                   |                 |                            |                             |                                 |\n| Excluding Round 1 | No              | 4527                       | 4509                        | 50.1%                           |\n| Excluding Round 1 | Yes             | 1187                       | 1206                        | 49.6%                           |\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNothing here suggests a bias towards trailing teams.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBut let's go even deeper. What if Foster and the NBA are smart enough to avoid this? Foster wouldn't just blatantly favor one team throughout the game, that would be to obvious. Foster would officiate the game normally for as long as possible, and only intervene when the trailing team needs him most. Right?\n\n----\n\n## 2.4 Does Foster favor trailing teams in high leverage situations?\n\nThis would be a tricky analysis to do with the previous dataset, for a few reasons. For one, what exactly is a high leverage situation? This is a similar problem that comes up when trying to discuss which players are more \"clutch\"--should clutch time be in the last 5 minutes of a game within 10 points? Last 2 within 5? Buzzer beaters only? The answer is obvious: whichever shows your favorite player as the most clutch.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe other problem is that the data used above includes intentional fouls. I don't think it's a big deal for the previous sections, mainly because there's enough data that it probably averages out. But if we limit ourselves to only the last few minutes, we're cutting our sample size by an entire order of magnitude. Then a handful of games with a ton of intentional fouls could really skew things.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBut! The NBA's Last Two Minutes reports come to the rescue. They do a TON of good stuff for us:\n\n\n1. We now have a consistent, prior defined criteria for high leverage (games that are within 3 points at any point within the last 2 minutes). That way you know I'm not just picking the most \"convenient\" definition\n2. We can filter out intentional fouls, since they appear to be pointed out in the dataset.\n3. We get more than just foul calls. For example: out of bounds or traveling calls.\n4. We also get _non-calls_. This is important for us because it increases our sample size (and gives us a more complete picture.)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFrom here on, I'll be referring to \"decisions\" rather than \"calls\"--this is to emphasize that there are non-calls included in the data now.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThere is *one* downside to the data. The L2M report tells us which referees were present during the game, *not* which referee made the decision. So when I talk about the statistics for an individual ref, I'm really talking about the statistics for all games that included that ref, *not* which calls they specifically made. To help account for this, if a ref shares a game with Foster, I remove it from that ref's data. Why? If we assume that Foster is rigging games and other refs are *not*, then doing it this way will make it stick out more in the data. That is, if it's true that Foster *does* favor trailing teams, this will make it even more obvious.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n(I'll be honest, I finally did get a bit lazy with the data here. I can't do anything about the non-calls, but I could've probably at least merged this data with the previous data to identify calls that should be attributed to Foster. Sue me.) Alright, let's see the results. The format will be similar to before: if a ref favors the trailing team, we'd expect a % of decisions against the leading team >50%.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n| Data subset       | Foster Present? | Decisions against leading team | Decisions against trailing team | % of Decisions against leading team | Rank           |\n| ----------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------- |\n| All Rounds        | No              | 4191                           | 4319                            | 49.2%                               |                |\n| All Rounds        | Yes             | 237                            | 239                             | 49.8%                               | 31st out of 59 |\n|                   |                 |                                |                                 |                                     |                |\n| Round 1 ONLY      | No              | 2041                           | 2178                            | 48%                                 |                |\n| Round 1 ONLY      | Yes             | 109                            | 99                              | 52%                                 | 14th out of 58 |\n|                   |                 |                                |                                 |                                     |                |\n| Excluding Round 1 | No              | 2150                           | 2141                            | 50%                                 |                |\n| Excluding Round 1 | Yes             | 128                            | 140                             | 48%                                 | 27th out of 41 |\n\n\nThe minimum number of decisions here for a ref to qualify in the ranks was 100 for all rounds, 50 for round 1 only, 50 for round 1 excluded. \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOverall, there's basically no difference between who is advantaged in the final minutes of close games when Foster is officiating. If we look at JUST round 1, there appears to be a slight bias towards the trailing team. If we look only at later rounds, the team *leading* in the series has seen a higher percentage of beneficial calls when Foster is officiating.\n\n## Part 2.5: Summary and Conclusions\n\nIt's very dangerous to do an analysis like this where so many different subsets of the data are looked at. Given basically *any* dataset, you can get it to spit out your desired result if you slice up the data enough times. Yet despite checking almost every reasonable subset of data, there's not a single subset where Foster clearly stands out. In all of the measures of bias we looked at, Foster never even ranks top 8 (among ~30-40 refs) a SINGLE time. He's nearly always around middle of the pack.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEven if you still think some of the data looks suspicious, I think every reasonable person would be able to admit that his reputation is not proportional to the vitriol he gets online. Imagine watching a playoff NBA game with a friend who doesn't watch a lot of basketball and having this interaction:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\"Scott Foster is officiating? Shit, we're definitely gonna lose now.\"\n\n\"Why, is he a bad ref or something?\"\n\n\"He's called The Extender. The NBA makes more money when series are longer, so Foster always officiates when a team is trailing to make sure that they win.\"\n\n\"Oh wow, that sounds bad. How often does that happen?\"\n\n\"Well over the last 17 years, teams trailing in the series have won about 4 more games than we would expect under any other referee. And that's not all. If you exclude the first round, on average he calls 1 more foul against the leading team every 2 games. Fuck that corrupt piece of shit.\"\n\n\"...Oh.\"\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIt just all seems a little overblown to me.\n\n# Addendum on Chris Paul\n\nI didn't quite have the time to go deep on Chris Paul related stuff, but after a comment someone made, I did a quick look at the 13 playoff games Foster officiated with Chris Paul since 2015. I'll copy paste that here:\n\n| Game               | Year | Round | Game | Chris Paul Win? | Foster Fouls against Paul's Team | Foster Fouls against Paul's Opponent | Net Advantage to Opponent |\n| ------------------ | ---- | ----- | ---- | --------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------- |\n| Clippers v Spurs   | 2015 | 1     | 5    | No              | 10                               | 7                                    | +3                        |\n| Clippers v Rockets | 2015 | 2     | 6    | No              | 9                                | 11                                   | -2                        |\n| Clippers v Blazers | 2016 | 1     | 3    | No              | 6                                | 9                                    | -3                        |\n| Clippers v Jazz    | 2017 | 1     | 5    | No              | 6                                | 10                                   | -4                        |\n| Rockets v Jazz     | 2018 | 2     | 2    | No              | 9                                | 8                                    | +1                        |\n| Rockets v Warriors | 2018 | 3     | 1    | No              | 9                                | 4                                    | +5                        |\n| Rockets v Warriors | 2019 | 2     | 2    | No              | 5                                | 9                                    | -4                        |\n| Thunder v Rockets  | 2020 | 1     | 7    | No              | 5                                | 9                                    | -4                        |\n| Suns v Lakers      | 2021 | 1     | 3    | No              | 7                                | 6                                    | +1                        |\n| Suns v Bucks       | 2021 | 4     | 3    | No              | 8                                | 4                                    | +4                        |\n| Suns v Bucks       | 2021 | 4     | 6    | No              | 9                                | 7                                    | +2                        |\n| Suns v Pelicans    | 2022 | 1     | 2    | No              | 5                                | 9                                    | -4                        |\n| Suns v Clippers    | 2023 | 1     | 2    | Yes             | 10                               | 8                                    | +2                        |\n|                    |      |       |      |                 |                                  |                                      |                           |\n|       Totals             |      |       |      | 1-12            | 98                               | 101                                  | -3                        |\n\nThe record looks bad, but Foster's individual calls are about even when it comes to which team he \"prefers\".\n\nA decent amount of these games were pretty close, so to avoid any skewing from intentional fouls, I also looked at the last 2 minutes data. In games where Foster was officiating, the split of decisions that disadvantaged Paul's team vs disadvantaged the other team was 28-36.\n\nI.e., there was a net +8 decision *advantage* for Chris Paul's team. This is not a complete analysis, just a quick gut check using the data I had readily available. I may return to it in the future to try to get a fuller picture.",

This ref conversation always comes back down to these data tables and Foster is always one of the most accurate officials in the league. He might be a dick, but he’s good at his job and it’s a hard job, so they put him on Finals games, because they want the most consistent officials on the most important games. \n\nThere’s just a fine line between memes and discussion when it comes to the NBA, sometimes it’s hard for me to tell when people are being serious or not. But it definitely feels like they got a little serious about the “Extender” stuff and any casual fan who doesn’t watch a lot is just gonna see that and have it shape their opinion of him. But again, there’s a reason the NBA keeps putting him on the finals when he’s been getting shit for years; he’s good at making the right calls in real-time. He puts up numbers lol, numbers don’t lie",

He didn't have access to the FBI agents who worked the case or to any of the three co-conspirators (nor of course to any of the government cooperators).  This was a major shortcoming and prevented avenues of inquiry.  I have defended Foster repeatedly (online, on radio, in print) since 2011 against unsupported accusations (especially that he, like Donaghy, fixed games), but the NBA's probe was very limited (which is partly why their conclusions were, too).  Also know the FBI didn't have access to confidential electronic betting data and didn't think to research publicly-available betting lines (partly because they originally believed Donaghy).  All of this matters re how Foster was investigated.  The 134 calls may be totally trivial or, at worst, as Foster says, perhaps Donaghy \"pumped him\" for information without Foster's knowledge.

I'm convinced about the roughly balanced outcome of games officiated by Scott Foster. The only thing I would add to your analysis, and you may or may not have the statistical expertise to do this, is calculate some p-values or other significance measures to demonstrate whether the 3% increase is quantitatively significant or not using standard practices.\n\nWhat I'm not convinced by in general is analyses that compare the total number of fouls called against each team in a game. For me, these two things are obvious and essential in any analysis (1) teams foul at different rates and (2) calling fouls early against key players significantly influences games. In this case, looking at the outcomes of games (2.1) is the most convincing section. A more sensitive method that would factor everything in would be to look at something like the expected spread vs the actual spread. If you did find a statistically significant trend in games officiated by Scott Foster (which you did not), then it would be interesting to explore how with questions such as *Do star players of leading teams play fewer minutes in games officated by Scott Foster?*\n\nI'm glad you put this together, and I find it convincing. The reason I'm harping on this point is that, despite this evidence, I think the narrative and gut reaction is based on *something*. Somehow, he looks smug while making calls that seem to overly impact the game. Maybe they don't impact the final outcome much, or they don't amount to extending the series, but he does seem to make himself a more prominent factor in games than other refs. Does that narrative check out in some way, even if the \"extender\" nickname or gambling accusations are totally unfounded?\n\nGreat writeup.",

You decided the extender is just based on a trailing team winning. Being down 0-1 is not the same as being in a 2-1 or 3-2 situation. Another one is foul call numbers. Remember when people here were obsessed with on/off numbers until it was properly explained?\n  \n Foul calls can increase when a trailing team intentionally fouls or if they target a bad FT shooter. Not all foul calls are created equal just like not all assists are created equal. If OKC commits 50 potential fouls and gets called on 26 while their opponent commits 35 and gets called 25 you can say the stats show fouls were called equally but they weren't. In addition I've watched enough games to know that the Last Two Minute Report is full of very controversial interpretations that favor refs. Not only that. The idea that only the last 2 minutes actually affect the game is not really accurate. We have all seen situations where all it took was a bad 3rd foul call on a star to shift momentum in a game. \n  \nI guess what I'm trying to say is that not everything is measurable with big data. Stats have their place in helping us understand the larger picture but not always. Foster and his bias whistle has been discussed by agents players and many others who are not really your common redditors. \n  \nIn addition I really don't care who was hired to investigate. The NBA hired them with David Stern being known as a shady 'protect at all costs' guy. I do think there is a valid point as to their phone records. Donaghy's tendency to run his mouth would have implicated Foster a long time ago. He firmly maintains his position that his relationship with Foster was friendly and he was not involved. Even now knowing they'll never mend their friendship again. It's very plausible to have a close professional and personal friendship with someone without them knowing you are being involved in some dark shit.",

As an example I think in one of the okc vs pacers game we saw 4-5 fouls straight happen when rebounding. They were legit fouls. But also a foul we saw a lot of ref crews ignore (Mitchel Robinson, Turner, chet, etc. all got pushed a ton when trying for a rebound in other series).

The 23 pick was acquired from the Pacers shortly before Haliburton tore his Achilles. \n\nI just thought it was interesting that the three teams who’s picks are involved in this deal all have a starting PG that tore their Achilles this past season:\n\nPelicans - DeJounte Murray\nBucks - Damian Lillard\nPacers - Tyrese Haliburton\n\nI know that makes the trade even dumber— *trust me I know*. But pretty crazy coincidence nonetheless. DJM could return shortly after the New Year, while it’s unlikely we see minutes from Lillard and Haliburton this upcoming season.\n\nEdit: to add, the Pelicans acquired the Pacers 27 first from the Raptors in the Brandon Ingram trade. The Pelicans anticipated they’d want to move up for Queen in this draft, so prior to game 7, they made a deal with the Pacers where they swapped Indy’s 27 first for their first this year: pick 23. While the trade with the Hawks was objectively awful, it’s really hard to fault the FO for this one (as much as I want to shit on them even more than I already have), as the Pacers were looking like they’d be an easy top 3 seed next year coming off of this finals appearance. Save the “Haliburton had a calf strain and the Pels should have known something catastrophic could happen” for somebody else. No one has a crystal ball.",

    "selftext": "Look, I'm not an OKC fan at all. In fact, the only remotely happy memory of this season I have as a Bucks fan is watching them run them off the floor to win the NBA Cup! And I know the Pacers went on one of the craziest Finals run in recent memory at my expense, so I have a vested reason as a Bucks fan to not show them love (even though I do). But the discourse I'm seeing about these teams is ridiculous and only a much sadder reflection of the hot take culture built on the coasts that has gestated and poisoned the NBA for years. \n\nThe Oklahoma City Thunder are the most well run basketball organization in the league right now, and they are likely the next NBA dynasty. 2nd youngest team to win a title. Shai had one of the most dominant individual seasons in league history. 3rd best regular season record of all time. Best net defensive rating ever. And the Thunder have 12 first round picks in the next seven years. \n\nThe Pacers took a team scrappy defenders, a former Kings point guard languishing away, a former Raptors All-Star, and an inconsistent center to two very deep postseason runs in back to back years as well, playing some of the most explosive offensive basketball in a decade. Their timeline is likely wrecked now since Tyrese Haliburton sadly tore his Achilles, but they did what so many other favored teams this year couldn't. The Bucks were the only team they were favored to beat, and the smacked through the Eastern Conference.\n\nBut I need people to stop writing the Thunder off for something they had no control over. Some players push through injuries and others don't. Two of the Pacers opponents had players that rushed themselves back into games that had negative consequences that hurt them later. Damian Lillard tore his Achilles that will likely keep him out all of next season and end his career as a star, and Darius Garland injured his toe and his timeline to return is 4-5 months. It's not the first time an injury impacted a Finals series either. Magic Johnson injured his hamstring against the Detroit Pistons as well.\n\nI know a lot of fans extend this \"asterisk ring\" nonsense to every final (unless you're Kobe/MJ for some reason), because the Lakers started out with the \"Bubble/Mickey Mouse ring\" bullshit half a decade ago now. But this discourse of diminishing people's accomplishments is sufferable and killing any discussion of basketball, especially for teams in smaller cities. All we ever hear is how trash a player is until they win, and even winning isn't enough anymore. We are the only sport that encourages this disrespect ,from fans and former players. Winning a title with the Thunder, Nuggets, and Bucks feels like winning 3 in LA or Boston. It is not easy to build a contender in a small market in this league at all. What the Thunder and Pacers did this season should be celebrated, not shit on by people with more memes, agendas, or engagement bait. Not every Finals has to be part of some tired legacy war. We don't need to make this Love Island in a jersey.",

It wouldn't completely shock me if JT was trying to play through a calf strain though. the team was all in going for another  chip knowing they were not going to keep that core together next year. Also Tatum plays some of the most minuets in the league and the calf/Achilles injuries are often a result of over use. Not sure what i believe but i could see Tatum lowkey playing through a leg injurie before he popped it. Achilles ruptures are not usually a non contact out of nowhere type injury. Its more often due to the tendon starting to fray over time and then finally snapping",

He won playoff series unlike T mac, has some of the greatest playoff moments of all time, averaged under 20 ppg once and it was his rookie season. Averaged way more points than T mac, more assists, and did it way more efficiently. His highest ppg season is higher than T Mac’s. Better record throughout his career, better playoff record, better team success with way worse teammates. He was way more efficient than T mac aswell with 8% higher ts than him. Their highest mvp finish is both 4th so the argument his prime was way better is not enough to put him  above dame",

He and MJ are the only players ever to have multiple series ending shots and he’s the only one ever to have multiple series ending 3s. He is tied for 3rd in playoff gamewinners behind LeBron and MJ.

Rank these players/injuries by how much you think they impacted their teams this postseason, and the playoffs as a whole.  Again, this is not ranking the severity of the injury(s), but ranking how much the injuries ultimately impacted this postseason.  Feel free to add any I missed.\n\n\n\nDarius Garland (toe) - Missed games 3 & 4 of the Miami series, as well as the first 2 games of the Pacers series (which his team lost).\n\nSteph Curry (hamstring) - Missed the majority of Game 1 of the Timberwolves series (won), as well as Games 2-4 (all losses), and will probably miss Game 5\n\nJayson Tatum (achilles) - Was injured in the last few minutes of Game 4 in a series in which Boston trailed 2-1, and the Knicks had a large (though not insurmountable) lead when he was hurt.\n\nJimmy Butler (tailbone) - Missed Games 2 & 3 of the Warriors first round series against Houston, which then Warriors ultimately won.   Although you could argue he has continued to be hampered throughout the playoffs.\n\nEvan Mobley (ankle) - Injured in Game 1 against the Pacers, missed Game 2 (a loss) and has played in the remainder of the series.\n\nDamian Lillard (DVT/Achilles) - Missed Game 1 of the Bucks series against the Pacers.  Played in Games 2 & 3, and tore his Achilles in the first quarter of Game 4.  Bucks lost the series 4-1\n\nJa Morant (wrist/trigger finger) - Injured in the midst of Game 3, as his team lead by 30 points against OKC. The Grizzlies ultimately lost that game and Game 4, resulting in them being swept.",

    "selftext": "So, this probably sounds like a repeat of what so many people have been asking since the results of the Bucks in their series against Indiana. It led to one of the hottest topics right now, which is Giannis and whether or not he'll want to stay in Milwaukee, whether they'll trade him or not.\n\nSo, most of the conversation I've chimed in in always center on names only: \"Giannis with such and such shooter, Giannis with such and such driving the lane again and again.\" It's something I did as well early on, because who doesn't want to imagine an MVP/DPOY player churning out 27/12/5 games in the playoffs with their favorite team. Now, however, I'm wondering what teams actually would fit him - or what team would he fit into.\n\nWhile he has been on the recieving end of the, 'needs a reliable jumpshot' criticism for some years now, I think he was actually managing a career high mid-range percentage this season, which suggested improvement, and he's slowly begun to apply a somewhat deeper post game since he first worked with Hakeem the past season. He's shown that he acknowledged his weaknesses and does what he can to improve or compensate for them, which is all you can ask of a star player.\n\nThat said, he is also a player who's admitted to being comfortable when he's in control of the ball - something that Dame also conceded was an issue early on, because he couldn't simply be on Dame Time when he was finally in a spot where he had another teammate that actually needed the ball as much as he did. In turn, we saw how those two conflicting playstyles prevented them from becoming a fully cohesive duo.\n\nMy question is, with Giannis's playstyle and his own tendencies and preferences in mind...really, what team would he best fit with? What players would he possibly best mesh with, given that he has his methods to the madness of his game?",

One year he literally averaged 27 points and 8 assists on a blazers team that finished with the 3 seed in the west and didn’t make the all star team. \n\nAlso, I love all of the people that list guys who should be above Dame because they won championships and Dame didn’t (Klay Thompson, Kyrie Irving, etc..).

    "selftext": "**Phil Jackson, Kobe’s coach, on Kobe’s All- Defensive Team Selections:**\n\n“Kobe's defense, to be accurate, has faltered in recent years, despite his presence on the league's all-defensive team. The voters have been seduced by his remarkable athleticism and spectacular steals, but he hasn't played sound, fundamental defense. Mesmerized by the ball, he’s gambled too frequently, putting us out of position, forcing rotations that leave a man wide open, and doesn’t keep his feet on the ground.” \n\n**Zach Lowe in 2013 on Kobe’s All-Defensive Team Selections:**\n\n“If Bryant makes first or second-team All-Defense again this season, I’m officially ignoring this honor indefinitely when it comes to assessing a player’s status and career accomplishments. There will be no more “Player X has seven first-team All-Defense appearances” in this space as a way of justifying a man’s place in the NBA hierarchy. Bryant isn’t the first player coasting to undeserved All-Defense appearances based on reputation, but if he makes it again this season, it will be his most egregious appearance ever, and one of the most egregious in league history. It’s probably already time to start ignoring these honors, since Carlos Boozer received what I hope was an accidental vote last season, but Bryant’s selection would make it official.”",

I dont see why people are so upset about what T-Mac said. We can talk about what T-Mac could and couldnt do til we're blue in the face, but we keep forgetting the Kobe was literally developed under Phil and did NOTHING without him. \n\nThat's no disrespect to Kobe's legacy because at the end of the day, his career is still what it was. But we have to acknowledge that his greatness is heavily influenced by Phil Jackson's coaching and T-Mac never had that. Shaq went on to win without Phil, but he just went to another team with ANOTHER GOAT coach, Pat Riley. ",

    "selftext": "I was just curious how vast you all think the gap between these two players is.  Over the last 3 seasons Lamelo has played 105 games, Ja has played 120.  Lamelo has averaged 24/8/5 on 54% TS.  Ja has averaged 25/8/5 on 56% TS, and lead his team to the playoffs in 2022-23 and maybe this season (although I think Jaren Jackson was better than Ja this season).  \n\nJa is a much better finisher, but Lamelo is a much better shooter and probably has more defensive potential (although he has been lazy as shit on defense so idc if that matters).  I'd say they're about equal as passers.  Lamelo is almost exactly 2 years younger than Ja, and has an extra year on his contract.  \n\nIf Charlotte wanted Ja, how much do you think they would have to give up to get him?  Would Lamelo and one first round pick be enough?",

Anyways he standing 10 toes down and brought it up again and i am looking for some good reasons to give him because all he provides is dunk highlights. Now i like kobe but i actually think his atheltism being a level below actually helped him as it forced him to be more skilled. Could any of yall help provide me with footage, other players statements, etc to make my case. I have an interview of kobe himself about having to work hard in the off season but wondering if phil jackson and others may have spoken on it as well. \n\nEdit: i just realized i typed it wrong my friend didnt say \"could be one of the most athletic players to have played in the nba\" like in the group. What he said was that \"Kobe could be THEE most athletic player EVER to have played\" like #1",

Imagine Belichick putting up with all that. Look at what Kobe and Carmelo had said of Phil Jackson.

    "selftext": "\nSome of Kobe's most epic playoff collapses analyzed in further detail.\n\n\n\n\n1. 2004 NBA Finals vs. Detroit Pistons\nResult: Lakers lost 4–1.\n\nStats: 22.6 PPG, 38.1% FG.\n\nContext: The heavily favored Lakers (with Shaq, Kobe, Malone, and Payton) were stifled by Detroit's defense. Kobe struggled with shot selection and efficiency. Critics pointed to his high-volume shooting (especially in Game 3: 11-of-27) as a factor.\n\n2. 2006 First Round vs. Phoenix Suns\nResult: Lakers lost 4–3.\n\nGame 7: 24 points, 8-of-16 shooting — took only 3 shots in the second half.\n\nContext: Lakers blew a 3–1 series lead. In Game 7, Kobe was passive in the second half, which sparked criticism that he \"quit\" on his team — something he denied, saying he tried to get others involved. This remains one of his most controversial games.\n\n3. 2008 NBA Finals vs. Boston Celtics\nResult: Lakers lost 4–2.\n\nGame 6: Celtics won by 39 points — biggest blowout in Finals history.\n\nStats: 25.7 PPG on 40.5% FG for the series.\n\nContext: Kobe had trouble against Boston’s elite defense. In Game 6, he shot 7-of-22. Critics argued he couldn’t lift the team without Shaq.\n\n4. 2011 Playoffs vs. Dallas Mavericks\nResult: Lakers swept 4–0.\n\nGame 4: Lost by 36 points; Kobe had 17 points.\n\nContext: Defending champs were dismantled by Dirk Nowitzki’s Mavs. Though Kobe played well in spurts, the Lakers collapsed as a team. The sweep marked the end of the Lakers’ mini-dynasty under Phil Jackson",

LeBron shoots a fabulous 35% from the field on wide open shots.\n\n2. 2010 NBA ECSF: LeBron James very visibly quits on his team, despite having home court advantage. Gets blown off the floor on his home court, losing by 30+ in Game 5. LeBron shoots 3-14 and has as many TOVs as FGs. Follows that up with a 9 TOV game to close the series. Then, abandons Cleveland despite back-to-back 60+ win seasons.\n\n3. 2011 NBA Finals: Outplayed by Jason Barea. Biggest meltdown by a superstar in NBA history. Enough said.\n\n4. 2025 1st Round: Playing alongside a 5x All-NBA 1st team player in his prime, manages to lose a 1st round series in 5 games. Visible lack of aggression and settling.",

    "selftext": "I’ve been thinking about this lately. LeBron James for much of his early career, especially in Cleveland, he was forced to be the system rather than play within one. The offense revolved almost entirely around his ability to create and score, often with limited help or structure.\n\nCompare that to guys like Kobe or MJ, who played within Phil Jackson’s triangle offense — a real system that emphasized spacing, off-ball movement, and shared responsibility. It makes me wonder:\n\nWhat if LeBron had a coach like Phil Jackson early on?  \nWould playing in a more structured system from the start have made him even greater? Would it have helped him conserve energy, build chemistry faster, or win more rings sooner?\n\nCurious to hear your thoughts.",

A *resounding* \"no\".\n\nBecause that's **not** how Phil Jackson worked.\n\nIn his autobiography, he cited both MJ *and* Kobe as \"uncoachable\": not meaning they were bad teammates, but rather that their talent and style were so enormous, you'd be limiting them if you assigned them strictly \"typical\" roles in an offense. The Triangle was less about controlling Jordan/Kobe, and more about maximizing the people *around* them, so you didn't have 4 guys standing flat footed while MJ/Kobe ran iso on every play. Which for decades only made for dazzling plays, beefed up stats, and losing basketball (see: Allen Iverson and Joe Johnson). Hypothetical Phil is running whatever offense maximizes his stars' support. Since LeBron is smart enough to define exactly what that is, he's definitely getting input on that decision.",

But he won’t do it anywhere near the same effectiveness as running full steam to the rim. \n\nIf you have LeBron on your team, you would be a fool to not use him in trying to get him downhill, particularly young LeBron who had less of a ‘bag’. You would run a lot of high pick and rolls, and try to get him space to get to the rim at speed. He does have a ‘bag’, but his variety is not the same, where Jordan was equally as deadly in all these ways, LeBron used them as a back up if his preferred method didn’t work. \n\nThis difference is inherent to system based offences. The ability to be deadly in multiple ways dictates the type of plays that can be run for you, and makes you more adaptable with different types of talents. While LeBron is obviously a top 2 player ever at minimum, he does not work as effectively in this way.",

    "title": "Kobe Bryant",
    "selftext": "I want to start this out with rest in peace. Kobe is an nba legend and definitely a top 10 player of all time. This is merely an argument that he is not top 5 and def not the goat.\n\nHe won TWO finals Mvps, One Mvp, Isn't the top in almost any statical category or average categories and we're out here calling him the goat? Top three? Even top 5?\n\nIn my opinion, Kobe is number 7 all time. My list is Lebron Michael Kareem Magic Bird Russel. Argue with that list all you want I don't care but I will make the case that Kobe is lower all time then each and every one of them.\n\nCase 1: Lebron, Lebron averages more points, has two more finals mvps and two more mvps, is the all time point leader and had more long lasting dominance then Kobe. He has only one less championship then Kobe Bryant but Lebron played with teams that were just as bad as what Kobe had to deal with later in his career but he turned the Cav's into an unstoppable eastern division menace playing solo. Lebron is better than Kobe. He's a better player than Kobe. Has more iq than Kobe. Isn't as much of a ball hog and still averages more points. Lebron is better. And also Lebron has a winning record in the games where both of them played each other.\n\nCase 2: Michael Jordan, Do I really need to make the argument for 6 championships, 6 finals mvps 5 mvps, 10 scoring titles and the highest average point scoring tied with Wilt mother fucking 50 point season Chamberlin? He was the center piece and by far the greatest player on one of the greatest teams ever. He was the best player in the league by an absurd margin and a million other moments. He is just as clutch if not more clutch then Kobe Bryant and he won more championships even without a prime top 10 player like he had with Shaq.\n\nCase 3: Kareem. Not once in the history of the NBA has a player been as dominant as Kareem was. There has never been a greater difference between the best player and the second best player ever. He won finals mvps when Magic fucking Johnson was playing on the court. Who is by the way also higher than Kobe is all time. Kareem retired as the all time leading scorer and was only a slightly watered down version of Lebron's leading dominance. He's tied with Michael in terms of chips and has 6 mvps and two finals mvps. He's tied with Kobe in terms of final mvps and just gaps him otherwise.\n\nCase 4: Magic: Magic Johnson is THE best point guard ever. Steph curry is the only other player in that conversation but it is a distant second place. He is the best playmaker the nba has ever seen. Had a more accomplished career then Kobe in 7 fewer seasons, won 2 mvps and 5 championships in a league where they had to face the Larry Bird Celtics who by the way is also higher all time then Kobe Bryant. Magic Johnson's only peers in terms of raw passing talent is Jokic and while he's more technical and solid, Magic gaps him in terms of winning. Jokic might stack up those Mvps but Magic only has one less than him while also having 5 more championships and two more finals mvps. Magic generated the offense for one of the best teams ever and did it all in just thirteen seasons. Magic was also a player who won despite not having a prime top 10 player for most of his chips. He had Kareem but by the latter bit of his career Kareem was not what he used to be. Kobe had prime shaq for years and won chip after chip after chip while not getting a single mvp during his three peat. The only argument I can get about Kobe over magic is that Magic was the worse scorer, but Magic also won just as much. Kobe was a ball hog and he had the most success when he was a second option. As a first option he won two championships. As a first option magic won 3. In a shorter period of time may I remind you.\n\nCase 5: Larry Bird, Besides for Steph curry Larry bird is the greatest three point shooter in the nba and also was an extremely underrated playmaker. He was the second best playmaker in the league behind magic and was far above Magic in terms of offense. He also had a much shorter career than Kobe Bryant but won 2 more mvps and an extra finals mvp. However, he and lebron are the only ones who have fewer championships than Kobe. But Kobe also didn't have to deal with a prime top 5 player on an opposing team on a superteam. Bird was the best player by a long mile on an absurdly good 80's Celtics team and three peated mvps. Much more impressive then three peating championships with Shaquille a fucking o'neale and Phil Jackson if I do say so myself.\n\nCase 6: Bill Russel. He had a thirteen year career. He won 11 championships. An 8 peat and a repeat and an extra championship because why not. Sure he had zero finals mvps but it also hadn't been invented yet and I think you might wanna look at the official name of that award and try to guess just how many more Russel would have won compared to Kobe. Russel won a triple crown with a march madness win an olympic gold medal and an nba championship. Russel is quite possibly the greatest defensive player all time and was a great player. He beat out wilt Chamberlin so decisively it's insane. Sure Larry and Magic were rivals, but Russel dominated Wilt who was in his own right a top 15 player so hard he won 9 more championships than him. He as many championships compared to wilt then Michael Jordan and Larry birds career championships put together. Sure it was a different time and a weaker era, but nobody else could dominate quite like Russel could so the idea that he's anything other then much better then Kobe is absurd. How hard do you have do dominate even a weaker league before people start respecting you?\n\nI don't care if you think that Bill Russel is the goat or that Larry is the goat or Michael is over Lebron. But Kobe is below all of them. He's statistically by the way not even that clutch. Not next to even Leletdown.\n\nof course however, I hope I don't need to say that rest in peace. Gone far too soon.",

His case for top 5 is legit when you factor in his elite scoring, two-way play, and the fact that he won both as a co-star and the main guy. You’re leaning heavy on accolades and dominance, but that overlooks how much harder the league was in Kobe’s era more talent, more competition, more pressure.\n\nI’m not saying he’s top 3, but I’d definitely put him closer to 5 or 6. You could argue he ranks over Bird or Russell depending on how much you value skill and era context. Jordan, LeBron, and Kareem are almost untouchable, and I get Magic’s edge in playmaking, but Kobe’s overall game and clutch resume make him more of a threat than you’re giving him credit for.\n\nAlso saying he’s “not even that clutch” just doesn’t line up with reality.",

I am a massive massive Kobe fan (tons of shoes/books/jerseys, used his numbers for screen names etc as a kid) but I think most reasonable people would put him somewhere in the 5-15 range all time depending on when they were born. \n\nA lot of younger fans who only saw his later years or are used to today’s game tend to underrate him because of box score stats/efficiency/pace numbers being much different now vs then. The spacing was much worse, the paint was clogged, and offenses weren’t as optimized as they are today. It was a lot of ugly iso ball league wide during the 2000’s and the numbers reflect that. \n\nMoreover, we’ve seen attention this year on how Jokic is one of the few guys who consistently shoots end of quarter/half heaves, and how it knocks a few % off his 3 pt %. Kobe was notorious for taking ill-advised shots (some of which wouldn’t be considered bad shots in a post-steph world), but he also took a ton more end of shot clock/end of quarter grenades compared to any other player I’ve watched. This IMO deflated his shooting/efficiency numbers to look worse than they actually were.",

    "selftext": "Tom Thibodeau has now officially been fired, but honestly, I don’t think he gets nearly enough credit for the way he pulled together this Knicks team -a franchise that had no real culture to speak of. For years, they were a laughingstock around the league. Even during the Carmelo Anthony era, they didn’t achieve this level of success. Sure, you can pin Game 1 against Indiana on him, but I don’t think the series was lost there -and let’s be real, no one expected them to make it to the Conference Finals. Taking out Boston was the biggest upset of this year’s playoffs.\n\nIs he a championship-caliber head coach? Maybe not. But let’s not forget he has a ring as an assistant coach -he built the defensive backbone of that 2008 Celtics team. Thibs might not be the guy you hand the keys to a superteam, but give him a ragtag group, and he’ll make them believe they’re contenders. And frankly, that’s no less impressive than winning it all with an already-stacked roster. Just look at the squads Phil Jackson, Popovich, Spoelstra, and Steve Kerr coached-they all went into those title runs as heavy favorites.\n\nThe thing with the Knicks is they tend to think they’re a Doberman when in reality, they’re still a poodle. New York goes absolutely wild whenever the Knicks look even remotely competent, and before you know it, players and coaches are suddenly facing sky-high expectations that were never realistic to begin with. So when it comes to firing Thibodeau, it’s hard to tell - is this just the city’s hype machine turning in on itself again, or is there actually a long-term plan in place? Maybe the front office believes Thibs did his part, and now someone else is needed to take the next step.\n\nThe problem is that both fans and execs tend to forget where the processes started in the first place. T*hibodeau was brought in because the Knicks were a dysfunctional organisation*. They needed a no-nonsense, tough-minded problem solver who could impose some structure and build a culture from scratch. The danger in letting him go is that you risk undoing all of that. *If the organization hasn’t actually changed at its core, then you’ve just removed the guy who was holding it all together* and you’re right back where you started.\n\nThis has been the story of Thibs’ career. Dysfunctional franchises call him in. He fixes them up. They overachieve. Expectations skyrocket. Then he's shown out of the door and the whole thing collapses. It happened in Chicago. It happened in Minnesota. And now it’s on the Knicks to prove that this time will be different. Has the franchise actually evolved? Or was this just another one of Tom Thibodeau’s illusions?",

Obviously he has warts — warts people anticipate and then react more strongly to given his reputational challenges and the way he’s polarizing as a figure — and lots of fans vocalized those complaints online. \n\nThibs turned the franchise around and brought extreme stability. In my view and corner of the internet, this was a sad day for the Knicks — even from fans, like myself, who thought the time was right for this change.\n\nI feel for him personally, and don’t think this was an easy decision for Rose. The most clear reaction from NYK fans to me was surprise, maybe excitement, and a real understanding that they have to get his replacement right.\n\nIronically getting fired now all but guarantees that Thibs will always be viewed positively by Knick fans legacy-wise.",

        "body": "I would strongly disagree that the Knicks overachieved this year. Yes, it was their first conference finals in a long time, and yes the Pacers are a great team, but frankly speaking, losing to them in 6 games with this new roster healthy after losing to them in 7 heavily injured last year is not overachieving. I know nobody expected them to beat the Celtics, but that was after a whole regular season of watching them lose to top teams; initially a lot of people were looking at them as a premier contender this season and by the time the playoffs rolled around that’s not what they really seemed like. That’s not to say they didn’t have a great year and that fans don’t have something to celebrate, but as a Knicks fan myself I think it’s accurate to say that the exit was both disappointing and illuminating.\n\nFor one, the man started playing his bench like 3 games into the conference finals. Lineups that haven’t touched the floor all season or postseason were playing critical minutes. In some situations it looked good, because these guys are NBA pros who practice together, but realistically if a guy hasn’t played meaningful minutes in months and you bring him in under pressure, the lack of chemistry with everybody who *has* been playing is going to be a clear disadvantage if you’re facing a team who’s been messing with rotations and going 9+ deep all year. I think that adjustment was clearly made out of desperation and probably against Thibs’ instincts regardless, not a good thing to have happening in a conference finals.\n\nBut really the most important thing is that Thibs isn’t just seen as a hardass, he is seen as a defensive specialist. As you mentioned, he is a champion as a defensive assistant coach, and last season when the Knicks were fully healthy around January, their defense was some of the best in the league, even with Brunson on the floor. Watching the games, it was not a team that you felt could put up 140 any given night like this regular season Knicks team was; it was a team that you knew was going to outwork the other squad every night, swarm on defense, and create enough turnovers that a win would always be on the table, even if the scoring wasn’t all there. This season, having KAT on the floor along with Brunson, losing Hartenstein and DiVincenzo, Bridges underperforming (for the most part, he did have some great moments) as a poa defender, I think the identity of this new Knicks roster is pretty clearly oriented towards offense, and that is not Thibodeau’s jam. He firmly stuck to old habits, and there’ve been reports that these were issues that were brought to his attention that he sort of just dismissed, in a way I’m sure you can imagine Thibs doing. Ideally the team would bring in a strong offensive assistant or two that he’d defer to somewhat on that side of the ball, but I don’t think he’d really be down with that either. Thibs’ teams are his teams, and I respect that, but at the end of the day I just think this roster changed in a way that does not fit his coaching style too well anymore.\n\nThere’s also behind-the-scenes stuff, you never really know what’s true especially so soon after a firing, but I’ve read several things like concerns about Bridges signing his extension (which he will most likely take pay cut for) if Thibodeau was gonna keep coaching, internal shit like that. Again, all speculative, but apparently the players were also heavily consulted about this before the decision was made.\n\nI’m really grateful for the way Thibs helped turn the organization around, his role in that was huge, but Leon Rose and this front office are the architects first and foremost, I trust their decision-making. The moves they’ve made have taken the team a step further every year, and I would bet my house that they’re not taking fan noise or any “hype train” into account when they’re making personnel changes. I know it’s fashionable to hate on the Knicks and their fans, especially at the moment, but I promise their front office is not worried about Sidetalk. This was a basketball decision, we’ll see how it plays out but I personally think Thibodeau brought this team as far as he was going to.",

There is no denying that Thibs built the Knicks from a dysfunctional has-been into a competent competitive ECF teams. \n\nNearly all the discussion I’ve seen (mostly Reddit) from people who disagree with the firing, believe it’s unfair because of what Thibs has accomplished, namely what you describe in your post, OP. And many Knicks fans say they are okay with the firing because Thibs is a culture builder but doesn’t have the offensive X’ and O’s to overcome Brunson’s and KAT’s defensive flaws and get this team over the top. He defaults to his comfort zone of defense and heavy minutes for the starters. \n\nThe Knicks front office has to ask “Can Thibs take this roster to the next level or has the team plateaued under his tutelage?” And if they think the team plateaued then they have to find a new coach because they have a very good starting line up. They aren’t bringing in a bigger star than Brunson and KAT. Bringing in a new coach that builds on the foundation that Thibs built is a logical next step. A team like the Knicks, in one of the major markets with a deep history, has to make the decision that they believe leads them to championships. They can’t just be satisfied with being competitive in the East. \n\nI think what’s missing in this conversation is recognition that firing Thibs was the right move, it is also risky and can fail but staying the same most likely means achieving the same result. And the pressure is on the Knicks to find the right coach to build upon the foundation that Thibs laid down.",

When you play your core 5,6 guys a lot of minutes, and they are durable, they developed chemistry quickly through reps. And when they are playing against the opponents bench, they have the talent advantage as well.  The problem is that your core gets tried and can't play at that level for 40+ minutes, especially in the playoffs when the schedule is tighter. And since he hasn't played his bench, the bench players aren't going to do anything in the playoffs. Malone had the same problem, but he was able to get a ring in 2023 because of Jokic and fatigue wasn't a factor since they blitzed through every other team ",

There's one story that has always stuck with me where him and Paxson got into a physical dust-up after a Bulls game that went to overtime. Noah was coming back from a foot injury and was on a minutes restriction. You can guess what happened. \n\nThe beat writers all say that off the court Thibs is a great guy, a real cut-up.

Once Butler was gone that's when it really fell apart.\n\nAs for Minnesota...in Thibs first year they were ass with only 31 wins and finished 13th. Second year playoff appearance. Third year they were ass again and Thibs was rightfully shown the door. Saunders took the helm, was ass. Some of that on KAT being unavailable due to injury, and because it was still the crappy roster Thibs built there. Saunders gets fired the next year, Finch gets hired, they get back on track.\n\nI feel like the \"Thibs leaves teams and they collapse\" thing is so overblown. You can give that to the Bulls if you want to. But I put that collapse more on the terrible ownership who consistently get in the way and show they're fine with being mediocre so long as fans are still selling out home games. With Minnesota, I don't know how you can call it a collapse when they were bad-mediocre with him there outside of one season they got to the playoffs. They collapsed again the next season WITH him there. After two years, they get back to being a competitive team once they hire a legitimate coach.",

But as I’m sure you know we’ve seen the issues with his coaching style throughout the season and the inability to adjust to the new roster.\n\nThe offense way too often devolved into Brunson or Kat isos and didn’t involve anyone else including each other. We’ve heard that the player exit interviews were influential in this decision and I imagine this has a lot to do with guys like Kat Mikal and OG complaining about the offensive system and identity.\n\nObviously the minutes is the loudest complaint people have but it’s a symptom of a bigger issue which was his inflexibility in rotations and adjusting to matchups. I think the clear example here was Hart being a poor matchup in the pacers series constantly getting switched onto Siakam. I know he obviously moved to the 2nd unit yet still got huge minutes where someone  like precious could have made a difference slowing Siakam down.\n\nThibs has designed some of the most efficient defenses in nba history and I know it’s hard to do that with Kat and Brunson as your top guns but he could have staggered their minutes more and better utilized zone schemes and switching to overcome that.\n\nI’ll always love Thibs like I’ll always love Julius Randle and this is ruthless but I understand this roster isn’t reaching its potential with him and you can’t have everyone outside of probably Brunson and Hart disgruntled with him going into next season.\n\nStill tho it’s once a Knick always a knick and in my estimation he’s on the Mount Rushmore of Knicks coaches with Red Holzman Pat Riley and JVG",

Kobe was still great and Howard came back pretty good but Howard was not affecting the game as much as he did pre back surgery.

So that's a toss up.\n\nNash didn't need to be Nash but yeah injuries.\n\nKobe assessment is just wrong.  Kobe was great with and without the ball.  Steve Nash actually unlocked even more off ball possibilities with what Kobe already showed throughout his career.\n\nGasol assessment is wrong.  He was well below what he was 2009-10ish and quickly dwindled down the PF hierarchy in 2013.  The most complete player was obviously Kobe lmao.\n\nHoward assessment for the season is okay nothing to really talk about \n\nAgreed with the last part if injuries all still happened.",

This is an example of Simpson's paradox. \n\n[Clutch shooting and evaluation of NBA players](https://youtu.be/99JYHjZkSw8?si=FFYA3U_vPEbtgjv0) Here I analyze clutch shooting from the perspective of multiple testing, showing that (as many of you know well) patterns detected from small sample sizes can lead to undeserved hype. I also show that p values can be useful to determine what plus/minus statistics are actually meaningful and which are not.",

    "selftext": "I think eventually this will go from an anamoly to a common precedent for top picks. As discussed countless times, NIL is a big factor because these players are fine with losing money because they've already made quite enough as a college player and know they'll still be well off from their incoming endorsements and rookie salary but also, there are very few teams at the bottom that are starved for talent where the prospect will become \"The Guy\" from day one. This won't be an issue for every player but there are a lot of players coming in with enabling agents and this perception of a brand.\n\nNever in the league has there been this amount of talent, but at the same time that means that there just aren’t many teams at the bottom right now that are totally starved for talent — where a prospect walks in and becomes *The Guy* from day one. That kind of situation is rare unless you’re someone like Cooper Flagg or you're going to a team like Brooklyn or Washington. We are getting closer to the day where every team has at least one star or future star, although we aren't quite there yet.\n\nWith the lottery, there isn't a guarantee you're being selected super high by a bottom team, but even just assuming you're a top 5 talent and you are, most of the bottom teams next year will most likely be drafting a player to *complement* another core piece.\n\n* **Raptors** already have Scottie Barnes\n* **Hornets** have LaMelo and Brandon Miller\n* **Suns** still have Book\n* **Hawks (via Pels)** have Trae\n\nYou might still have a couple teams like the Wizards or Nets that are blank slates and top guys will try to maneuver their way toward, but in general, I think we’re heading toward a new normal where elite prospects care more about their own personal fit + role, than just being as high of pick as possible and not losing $$$. It'll be up to teams to pull a Danny Ainge and draft that player regardless but I think eventually we'll see a case where a player pushes for a trade (this has happened in the past) or refuses to sign their rookie contract and goes overseas or sits out.",

Suns get younger/draft capital and spurs get another elite shot creator to play along side wemby. Ive thought about this for a while but theres rumors that Booker will request a trade now. What would you change in the package?",

Just because there are a lot called in basketball doesn’t mean the audience doesn’t deserve to see what happened with their own eyes. \n\nIn my opinion this is a HUGE weakness of the broadcast. But it happens so much I feel like people have accepted it as normal. It’s not normal and people should be pissed about it.\n\nFuck r/nba for removing this.\n\nEDIT - a lot of you think this would somehow change the flow of the game, as if they don’t already show a replay after every foul. In fact, they usually have time to show multiple. My beef is that they refuse to show the blown call as a replay. The viewer deserves to see a blown call. There is ample time to see it when getting set for the free throw. Every time. “Changing the rule book” will not happen until we have something as simple as the viewer being able to decide themselves if a foul was correct or not. ",

He is one of eight players to ever achieve the basketball Triple Crown, and was inducted to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1980. He was also part of the NBA 50 and 75 anniversary teams.\n\nBut besides that, Lucas is an extremely intelligent human being. After his NBA career ended, Lucas pursued publishing and educational endeavors. In 1974 he co-authored a New York Times best-seller, The Memory Book, and he developed an educational product he named the Lucas Learning System. Along with multiple editions of The Memory Book, Lucas has written over 70 other books, most of them related to education or memorization.\n\nHe could also perform an astonishing parlor trick: He could memorize 50 pages of the New York City phone book in one sitting. At a party co-hosted by teammate Bill Bradley and the writer Dick Schaap, Lucas demonstrated the trick for chess champion Bobby Fischer, who was awestruck.",

KD is a superstar, Beal is ... idk what he is.\n\nHas there ever been a similar situation in the NBA, where a team is saddled with an untradeable albatross, so they have to ship off a much superior player?

Jalen Brunson. Booker has always been very overrated.\n\nAlso this year he couldn’t even hit the playoffs and somehow this “ Superstar “ is better than a guy who led a team with very weak depth to the ECF?

    "title": "What is the best path forward for the Phoenix Suns this off-season?",
    "selftext": "It feels like the Suns are at a very pivotal inflection point for their franchise. The new ownership went all-in on a KD/Booker/Beal core which has seemingly failed, and they now need to choose a direction. There are several options to choose from, so I'm curious what everyone's overall thoughts are on what would be the best option for Phoenix moving forward as they are in a very precarious position. At the moment, I see three main courses of action:\n\n1. **Keep Booker and Durant.** This decision would commit them to trying to compete for the next 2-3 years with KD still under 40 years old. With limited picks and trade assets, they would really need to win at the margins and nail every move to improve the roster into a contending status.\n2. **Keep Booker and trade Durant.** This path would primarily be focused around a mini-reset where KD is traded for assets that can be used to re-tool the roster. The end goal would be to get the roster back into a contending state within \\~2-3 years with Booker as the centerpiece.\n3. **Trade Booker and Durant.** This would be a full reset of the team where both players are sold off for  as many assets as they can get, and a full rebuild of the roster would be underway. Phoenix does not control their picks through 2031 though, so a full-on tank rebuild is difficult unless they trade for their picks back.\n\nFor reference, here is where Phoenix currently stands:\n\n* On contract for next season: Kevin Durant, Bradley Beal, Devin Booker, Grayson Allen, Royce O'Neale, Cody Martin, Vasilije Micic, Nick Richards, Ryan Dunn, Oso Ighodaro\n* KD has 1 year left on his deal, Booker has 3 years left on his deal, Beal has 2 years left on his deal (1 being a player option) and his no-trade clause is still in place\n* Pick Status\\*\\*\\*: 2026 1st (least favorable of PHX, WAS, and ORL). 2027 1st (least favorable of UTH, CLE, and MIN). 2028 1st (least favorable between WAS and PHX). 2029 1st (least favorable of UTH, CLE, MIN). 2030 1st (least favorable of PHX, WAS, MEM)\n* Outgoing Pick Status: Houston owns 2025 1st, 2027 1st, 2029 1st. Washington owns swap rights in 2026, 2028, and 2030 (with other various teams owning swap rights as well for certain years). 2031 1st is outgoing to Utah.\n\n\\*\\*\\* Some of these swaps are more complex and have conditions too long to list in an easy to read manner. I tried to simplify them as best as I could for the purposes of this post, but the full pick conditions can be found [here](https://basketball.realgm.com/nba/draft/future_drafts/team).   ",

Moreover, I don't think the Suns would want to pay him almost 60M (on top of paying Beal 50M+ that they couldn't get rid of) just to tank.\n\nI think Beal is very comfortable getting his 50M+ every year and not needing to play hard. Just let him play with a bunch of min vet contract till 2027 and then starting to rebuild then.",

Trade Durant, Keep Booker, don't fully bottom out and tank, and hope that some good to great free agents are willing to sign with you. I think is very unlikely to happen. \n\n2. Trade both, and start the rebuild. The market for all stars like Booker changes a lot over time. Durant you likely have to trade right away, because their is to great a risk of his play falling off and him losing value on the trade market (he is old). With Booker you can likely just wait until some team wants to go all in (hopefully this summer, or next summer), and capitalize. I would be in no rush to trade him until someone really wants him. The market for Rudy Gobert, Pascal Siakam, Mikal Bridges, Devin Booker changes a lot depending on the time and needs of other teams. There is no need to trade him for nothing like the Raptors did with Siakam.\n\nAs fans we sometimes forget that the NBA is a **business** and is not just about winning. Teams make a lot more money by putting out a respectable team with a name that people recognize. They might just hold onto Booker and not fully bottom out, because that might be the most profitable thing to do.",

    "selftext": "I'm curious as to how well Team USA would play if they composed their team based on the best \"role players\" for their team instead of the traditional get as many superstar/star players on their team. An example of a starting lineup would be what they ran when they played in the last Olympics. In the game against France and Serbia they ran a line up of Curry, Booker, Lebron, Durant, Embiid. All superstar players. Now the problem that is talked about would be that each of these players are the main vocal point of their respective teams. The offense or the \"system\" goes through them. So when you put them together on a team, in a way they have to change how they play which puts them in a bit of an unusual position and adjustment period. I recall Booker even saying that he was willing to the \"dirty work/take on a more of a role player mindset\".  Now team USA won so of course it worked, nothing to complain about but, I wonder how good a Team USA would be if it was compromised of an \"actual team\" going into the next Olympics. An example would be the Oklahoma city thunder, now obviously not every one on this team plays for USA but use the hypothetical to imagine if they were. Wouldn't Team USA just select the Thunder team (starting lineup, plus a couple of their role players) for their Olympic team? They just proved they are the best basketball team in the best basketball league in the world. so in this hypothetical team let me paint a scenario of what a potential Team USA roster would be composed of if it was based on a more traditional way of building a team in the NBA is. The best role players in each of their respected positions surrounded by a couple of superstar players.\n\n\n\n An example, \n\nLineup= G-Anthony Edwards G-Jalen Williams F-Amen Thompson F-Jaden Mcdaniels C-Bam Adebayo \n\nBench= G-Lamelo Ball G-Derrick White G-Keon Ellis F-Herb Jones F-Aaron Nesmith C-AD\n\nlooking at this roster you will say someone like jayson tatum is clearly better than all the Forwards listed here. And your right he definitely is but does this team need a scorer like tatum when it already has edwards jalen williams and bam who can score the ball well. just plug in amen thompson or jaden mcdaniels who are elite defenders and have scoring ability as well and more importantly they have been in that role for their respective nba teams. more so with mcdaniels of course.  again we can go on and on about who you would replace in the roster I listed the main point is instead of constructing a roster of superstars why not construct a team consisted of 2 or 3 superstars, great number 2 or 3 options on a team (jalen williams, Amen) and great role players (Ellis, nesmith). Almost like how an NBA team is contructed. ",

The US is always going to be at a continuity disadvantage, so what makes someone a great role player on a certain NBA team is not necessarily going to translate over to a completely different set of teammates playing a different system with FIBA rules. \n\nWith a more packed paint and fewer transition opportunities, Amen Thompson (who is considering playing for Jamaica along with Ausar fwiw) and Jaden McDaniels aren't going to be great FIBA role players on offense, they're just more opportunities for other teams to pack the paint. So the rationale behind superstars is that a Jayson Tatum can be 90+ percent as good on defense (if Tatum had the luxury of being a 3rd/4th option on an NBA team he would easily end up being an all-defense selection) and in addition can do some star player stuff if one of the other stars is hurt/in foul trouble/having a bad game.\n\nNo owner is ever going to allow the entire American contingent of his team to be team USA. Well maybe the owner of a bad team that wouldn't have enough talent to win in the Olympics would, but any team that's advancing deep in the playoffs and then following that up with the Olympics is pretty much punting the following NBA season. It just had a pretty big effect on the Celtics' title defense with only 3 of their players on team USA.",

Never took his team to the next level. Ok he was on bad teams but he's been on three different teams and the results are the same: nothing.\n\nSo many people roasting on Ant, Book, Donovan Mitchell, KD, Luka, etc. for their less-than-glorious playoff exits in recent years, but here's a guy making $44mil who has never done fuck-all post-season. Even when he played for the Olympic team he barely did anything. Instead, people like KD and Tatum and Jrue carried the team to gold.\n\nPlayers are accused of being empty stats guys, but in this case it's actually true?",

    "title": "This is shaping up to be a monumental off-season",
    "selftext": "Based on everything that's unfolding in the league right now, it looks like the league is gonna be shaken up dramatically this off-season. The win-now Dallas Mavericks just got the first pick, Wemby's Spurs got the second, All 3 of this year's 60+ win teams are in danger of losing in the second round, Giannis and KD are as good as gone from their current teams, the Celtics' payroll is catastrophic and their best player may have just torn his achilles. This off-season is gonna be a frenzy.\n\nWhat's gonna happen? Will the Spurs keep their 2nd pick and take Harper, causing a logjam in the backcourt between he, Fox, and the reigning ROY Stephon Castle? Or will they trade down, perhaps with the Nets, who have Cam Johnson and four picks in the first round this year? Or will they package the pick with some other assets in hopes to attain Giannis, creating the most freakish NBA duo we've ever seen?\n\nOr perhaps will it be the Mavs who enter themselves in the Giannis sweepstakes? Does Nico do what's expected and just keep the first overall pick and select Cooper Flagg? Or does he decide that Flagg doesn't fit the win-now timeline and send the pick away for someone who does, creating a big 3 in Kyrie, Giannis and AD that is sure to take the league by storm as long as they're healthy?\n\nWhat's next year's Celtics roster gonna look like? They don't have the money to keep both Jrue and KP on the roster, so which one do they choose to keep? Do they let both of them go? Assuming Tatum tore his achilles, do they decide that this is the end of the era and completely start from scratch and trade Tatum? If so, Kyrie is already gonna sit out all of next year with his ACL injury, so would it be crazy for Dallas to trade the first overall pick to Boston for Tatum in order to make a huge push for the title in 2026-27? Or maybe they decide to give themselves one last year to compete by trading Tatum to the Suns for KD, who could fill the Tatum-sized void for one last hurrah before his contract expires.\n\nSpeaking of the Suns, how are they planning on getting themselves out of the hole they got themselves in? It's basically a given that KD won't be on the team next year, but where will he go? Like I said above, Boston could be on the table, but what about OKC? Could OKC decide to part ways with some of their treasure chest of picks to give them another huge boost in the form of KD to essentially make them unbeatable in 2026? The Rockets currently own some of Phoenix's picks, could they decide to give them back to Phoenix in exchange for KD? Is Booker on the move too somewhere?\n\nAs you can see, there are a ton of questions that are going to be answered this off-season some way or another. It's our job to sit back and watch the madness. What are your predictions?",

    "selftext": "I’m talking about right now. I think currently Butler is better than Durant has been the last 5 seasons Butler has taken 3 teams to the conference finals and two of those 3 to the nba finals. Durant in the last 5 years only has a conference finals 2021 appearance, first round exit 2022, second exit 2023 and last year another first round exit this year he didn’t even make the playoffs. Jimmy has been more impactful for his team than Durant has been for any of his teams in his career probably except for OKC. And before you say anything golden state won before kd and with and after Durant. And they are still winning while he sits at home watching. Not to mention how golden state was at the bottom of the league and didn’t even make the playoffs last season before getting the next season and then just automatically getting into the playoffs and getting out of the first round vs the talented rockets team. Durant is holding phoenix back with his diva style and wanting to make a super team that just haven’t worked and now he’s most likely going to leave the suns and they are going to be stuck with a Mediorce core of Beal and booker and Beal who is just a overpaid Tyler herro and has one of the worst contracts in the league. What do you guys think of this?",

When he brings the ball up he's looking at what the offense is giving him and can step back and shoot it, make the pass or dribble in and score. Chet is part of the offense. He's running and getting open for catch and shoot 3s, or rolling to the rim, or if he has a lane driving and attacking the rim. He can pass but a lot of that is happening after the defense collapses.\n\nThere are things that Chet does better like being more mobile on defense, being a better shooter, and being able to get downhill better than Wemby. Like if you just swapped them out, and made Wemby play only the \"Chet role\" I think he struggles (obviously the Thunder would not do that and would orient things around Wemby).",

He has a crazy kind of athletic lanky style that is difficult to match up with. The way he just lanks about blocking shots and just kind of placing the ball in the hoop with those long stickly mantis-like limbs is truly something to behold. Definitely was wrong about this guy. I was really liking the Pacers to take it all, but man the Thunder is tough on both ends and Chet is a major factor.",

        "body": "I guess it comes down to leg muscles vs upper body muscles. Having strong arms, a strong back, etc. typically doesn’t help you run faster or jump higher. Stronger legs will, to some extent, depending on how strong your legs already are.\n\nThat’s why high jumpers don’t look like power lifters. They look a lot more like Chet Holmgren than Lu Dort. They’re quite lean. Their legs are strong, but strong legs don’t make you look like Giannis. Giannis could already jump through the roof when he was a skinny rookie—building a strong upper body helped his game in other ways, but it didn’t make him noticeably more “athletic” in terms of his running speed, jumping ability, etc.\n\nObviously you jump with muscles so yes if you’re a starved concentration camp survivor you would need to build leg muscle before you could reach your max vertical leap. But Holmgren is already in excellent shape. I don’t think he is going to add any significant height to his vertical leap by adding more muscle—and if he added enough muscle (would have to be a lot) he would actually lose some of his vertical leap because of the added weight.",

        "body": "The problem is with all of these stats that it doesn't take into effect context. And the context is the Magic offensive system is basically hand the ball to Paolo or Franz and pray they can make something happen. No I'm not joking, that is literally all there is. And Paolo being the primary offensive player on the team means he was the one required to make the most happen. He is inefficient because the magic offense REQUIRES him to be.\n\nIf you don't regularly watch our games it is very difficult to understand just how BAD the offensive gameplan is around Paolo and Franz. Everyone mentions the spacing but it is so much more then that. Due to the Suggs injury and the lack of any semblance of other lead guard play with Anthony Black not taking a step up and Cole falling out of the lineup, just getting the ball over the half court line without getting an 8 second call was a hassle (pretty sure we led the league in that department). Getting into an offensive set with only 15 second on the clock was already difficult. Now add in the injuries that messed up the entire first season of offensive growth. Now add in the lack of shooting around both players.\n\nAny time Paolo caught the ball and made a move inside he was crowded. There was no clean drives. Everyone says \"he needs to get back to attacking the rim\", my brother any time he got anywhere near the rim, he had not only his defender to beat, but the help defender, probably a third defender who was shadowing him, and someone else in the post ready for the block attempt.\n\nYou of course would ask, \"well then why would he attempt that shot? shouldn't he get the ball to an open player?\" And that would be a great question. And he did. For months on end he and Franz fed the ball to numerous wide open shooters who then went on to shoot one of the worst records on wide open 3 point attempts in league history. Literally historically awful on what should have been practice shots. Paolo taking low quality shots was statistically our best option. That's why I say he is inefficient by design, because if Paolo isn't taking those shots we probably don't break 80 points a game.\n\nThis is why we got Bane, and why the team drafted Richardson, and also why it sounds like we are hunting Tyus Jones or any other available PG and may even make one more trade involving more of our bench for another shooter. Our offense is literally not conducive to our best players, and forcing them to play poor basketball just to have a chance.",

They are both Under 25 years old players. But my hot take is both of them will be Top 15 players in the league next season. And maybe (just maybe) knocking on the door in that top 10. \n\n(Though among U25 yrs old players, I am betting on Ant and Wemby as the two plausible possible Top 10 players next season)\n\nGoing back, I think Cade and Paolo will be in contention with All Nba Second Team selection. (Cade already won third team last season, while Paolo was hit by injuries)\n\nWhat are your thoughts about them?\n\nI think they are arguably the 3rd and 4th best U25 yrs old players after Ant/Wemby.\n\n",

Cade already was a Top 15 player this past year - he finished 11th in All-NBA voting, and very narrowly missed second team.  I'm not saying improvement isn't possible, but a \"leap\" is very strong phrasing.  That would imply something like a 30/8/10 line, which is getting to seem a little far fetched.  Remember, the better you get, the less room there really is to improve, and there's not a ton of obvious places for it with Cade.\n\nPaolo is a little more possible, IF he can dial in a solid 3-ball.  That's currently holding him back from reaching his ceiling, and a very obvious spot where he could improve significantly and seems capable of it.",

If he does all those things, he's in the MVP conversation. And there are real problems he can fix to hit those numbers, so it's not like we're looking to burst through a brick ceiling.

Also all those contracts will be a smaller % of the cap as the years go on since the salary cap will likely go up 10% each year. 2027 (Paolos first new contract year) will be the toughest year.

Neither guy is bad on the other side of the ball, in fact both are good, but I think Dub is better as an overall player right now today because of the defense and his shooting efficiency being significantly better, even if it's on less volume.\n\nThat said, I think Paolo has a higher ceiling, and if you were drafting and these two guys were in it, you'd take Paolo because of that higher long term potential.\n\nFor me Paolo needs to become a better shooter, his efficiency is nowhere near where I would want it to be (his best season of eFG% is multiple points lower than Dub's worst season), and I'd like to see him rebounding better at his size (he's significantly bigger than Dub but only averages 2 rpg more). But I have no doubt that Paolo will get there and that we're only scratching the surface of how good he'll be. I feel the same way about Dub though.\n\nBoth guys are great and I look forward to continuing to watch them grow.",

It's a similar situation to Jaylen Brown imo, he might be able to be a solid first option but he's never needed to because of Tatum and the celtics being pretty good overall, guess we'll find out about that next season tho",

    "title": "[The Ringer] The Desmond Bane Trade Is a Risk the Magic Had to Take",
    "selftext": ">The NBA offseason arrived early with a bold blockbuster. Orlando gave up a lot to address its biggest weaknesses, but it also gave itself a legit chance to win the East.\n\nhttps://www.theringer.com/2025/06/16/nba/desmond-bane-trade-orlando-magic-memphis-grizzlies-draft-picks\n\n>My first reaction to and biggest takeaway from this trade didn’t center on Memphis’s next move or how many picks Orlando gave up to get someone who’s never made an All-Star team. My first thought was, in a nutshell, that the Magic can now realistically win the East. Some of this is thanks to the turbulent state of the conference they exist in—with apologies to the undeniably awesome Indiana Pacers, there is no clear favorite—but most of my optimism is baked into how fantastically Bane fits in on a young, improving roster that was so desperate for everything he provides. \n\n>Coming off an injury-plagued season that saw Paolo Banchero, Franz Wagner, and Jalen Suggs play a grand total of 97 minutes together, the Magic were not your typical 7-seed. They were ravaged by injuries and, even when relatively healthy, had no reliable outside shooting or secondary playmaker who could diversify their playbook. Enter Bane, a career 41 percent 3-point shooter who averaged 5.4 assists per game over the past two seasons. \n\n>Yes, a 50-win season in 2025-26 would have been conceivable without this trade. The Magic probably could’ve surrendered fewer assets for someone like Anfernee Simons and been marginally better on offense while taking a more than marginal hit on the other end. How many playoff games would that group win, though? Would the spacing have been that much better, and could someone like Simons actually ease the on-ball burden Banchero and Wagner feel in big games? ",

What I'm really tired of is the continuous glazing regarding the \"face of the league\" discourse, which to me just boils down to the fact that Americans (at least the so-called analysts involved) are feeling kinda butthurt by the league being dominated by non-American players in the last few years and are desperately trying to find an American player with \"aura\".\n\n\n\nTo me it's kinda wild as we have young players like Luka, Wemby, Shai, with prime superstars like Giannis and Jokic and even a group of American players like Tatum, Haliburton, Cunningham and Banchero (soon to be joined by Cooper Flagg) and the only player analysts keep talking about \"representing the league\" is Anthony Edwards, who is coming off a pretty disappointing performance in this year's conference finals.\n\n\n\nNot only that, but the guy seems inescapably attracted to creating controversies: from the homophobic comments in 2022 to the wide array of paternity-related controversies and having allegedly offered models large amounts of money to get an abortion; Ant also seems to possess the smallest vocabulary you've ever seen, getting fined for obscene language (and gestures) pretty often an articulating post-game interviews like someone who's yet to leave elementary school.\n\n\n\nAre we sure there's no better player to be \"the face of the league\", someone with better talents and behaviour? Is America really sure it wants to be represented by arrogance once again?",

His playoff scoring makes me think that he might be able to iron out his own shooting if the roster were better balanced with more shooting.     \n       \nWe saw how big of a jump Cade and the Pistons were able to make once they added some crucial spacing to the roster - I think Cade will make All-NBA whenever the hell they're finally announced - but Paolo has still been weighed down where he is most effective, on the interior, by the Magic's lack of spacing. I think his interior efficiency is seriously depressed by the Magic's poor shooting and if they can fix that he could see a shocking increase in his scoring.

But which team should he put Cooper Flagg into? Which team often favorite pretty-faced, loyal and juicy white boy. Denver aleady has a white dude, Boston was the defending champ. Only Dallas left.\n\nSo he told Dallas to tank, but he unwillingly gave Dallas 1st pick for free. They had to make sacrifice and then had that 1st pick in order to none \"NBA is rigged\" conversation. \n\nIf you noticed, all great 1st picks tend to play for not so dirty tanker or cursed franchise, for example Zion with Pelicans, Banchero with Magic, Cade with Piston, Wemby with Spurs and now Flagg with Mavs. Those bust 1st picks would be send to dirty tanker or cursed franchise.\n\nNBA is all about business and Adam Silver must nurture talent the right way.\n\n",

As for Sengun specifically, there’s a particular situation: if you watch the games (which Coach Udoka clearly acknowledges too), you’ll see that Sengun is not Houston’s primary offensive option. The possessions he gets are usually from beyond the three-point line, where he has to create on his own through isolations and individual skill, when Houston offense stucks. System does not help him, he find his own buckets. \n\nIn the team’s system, when Sengun gets the ball (Denver-style setup), there aren’t many off-ball cuts or screens happening he will be much more valuable and efficient. And beyond that, there aren’t even two reliable shooters around him who can create spacing and thrive next to a player with elite post-up ability and great passing skills like Sengun.\n\nI’d love to see Sengun in a scenario where all of those elements are present. Even so, he performed incredibly well—especially against a very experienced opponent like the Warriors and a historically elite defender like Draymond.",

    "selftext": "[Source](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6447184/2025/06/24/lakers-questions-2025-nba-draft-free-agency/)\n\n>“It’s tough to get that chemistry on the court without any practices. So I’m really excited to have the preseason with those two, so we can learn about each other on court a lot,” Dončić said after the Lakers were eliminated in late April. “I look back with Kyrie, when he got traded to the Mavs, we didn’t really connect on the court. We didn’t really know each other’s games. Obviously, we see the game, but we don’t see in-game as teammates. So we can see next year, we kind of just had a preseason together. It was just amazing.”\n\n>And with Dončić on the court, the Lakers were pretty good — 18-10 in the 28 regular-season games that he played. And when he started with Rui Hachimura, James, Reaves and Jaxson Hayes, the Lakers were 10-3. So, building on that is a good start. Which is good — because the pathways outside of internal growth aren’t all that exciting right now.\n\n>**Two, Dončić has been incredibly committed to his conditioning this offseason. He’s dropped significant weight and is working on strict diet and cardio training, according to a source with knowledge of the plan. In a shift from his normal offseason, he spent a month away from on-court work to focus more on his body. Dončić has looked visibly slimmer in photos and is now back working out with Slovenia readying for EuroBasket competition later this summer.**",

    "selftext": "By mid to late season, it seemed as if Jaxson Hayes had finally found his place in the NBA. As a highly mobile lob threat, he seemed to be an excellent match for a Luka-led team. His mobility also worked well in the Lakers' switching defense. At his peak, he was playing 24-25 minutes a game and making important contributions. He ended the season with the sixth highest EPM on the team, not as high as the five playoff starters but higher than Vando, Vincent, or anyone else on the bench.\n\nYet his minutes were curtailed toward the end of the season and then he barely saw the floor in the playoffs. Look at these stats.\n\nMonth: MPG, PPG, RPG, TS%\n\nJan: 16.1, 4.6, 3.7, .653\n\nFeb: 22.2, 7.5, 4.8, .732\n\nMarch: 23.5, 9.8, 5.9, .773\n\nApril: 17.3, 5.3, 5.3, .587\n\nPlayoffs (first 4 games): 7.8, 1.8, 2.0, .451\n\nPlayoffs (game 5): DNP (coach's decision)\n\nThis is especially perplexing because the Timberwolves are a large physical team that dominated the Lakers in the paint and on the boards. Rudy Gobert practically beat the Lakers single-handedly in Game 5, with 27 points and 24 rebounds.\n\nYet Lakers coach JJ Redick refused to put Hayes in the game, even putting in Maxi Kleber instead for a few minutes, who had never previously played on the team.\n\nAdmittedly Hayes didn’t play well in the early games of the series, committing a number of mistakes, fouling a lot, and picking up fouls.  But at least the Lakers went 1-1 in those first two games. Over the last three games, with Hayes seeing decreasing time game by game, the Lakers lost all three.\n\nWhat do you think happened? Here are some possibilities:\n\nTeams improved their scouting of Hayes, reducing his effectiveness.\n\nReversion to the mean: Hayes went through a good streak mid season, but couldn’t sustain it.\n\nTightening the rotation: Redick simply wanted to go with his strongest lineups, which he didn’t feel Hayes was part of\n\nFractured relationship: Hayes did something to anger Redick, who decided to ice him out.\n\nAs a Lakers fan, this turn of events leaves me really discouraged, not only for how the season ended but also for the future.. A month ago, I was feeling as if the Lakers had found their McGee (a 20-25 minute high energy lob threat) and just needed one other cheap center in order to compete. Due to his young age, I was looking forward to Hayes catching lobs from Luka for years to come. But now it seems like the Lakers need a major upgrade at center, which will cost them dearly in players or draft picks that they can’t really afford to spare.\n\nSo what do you all think? What happened to Jaxson Hayes?\n\n",

I liked him as a coach all season but I think this first playoff series really exposed some weaknesses, he seemed like he was on his heels the entire time adjusting to what Finch was doing and sort of throwing out hail marys. A few of the lineups he put out there were a bit crazy lol, and Barkley was right about what he said about playing Kleber, that’s kind of a huge middle finger to your actual rotation that has been healthy and playing this whole time. I think he should’ve gone back to what worked for them in the season more than he did, and just overall I think he needs to learn to make adjustments better. Clearly he’s very sensitive about his inexperience as we can see from that press conference but it has been glaring in this series imo.",

Because he's out of position, he is behind the play and tries to recover but is also unfortunately on the slower side. Since he's out of position and slow, this more often than not results in a free bucket for the opposing team or he fouls. He also very foul prone and gets himself into foul trouble very quickly.\n\nAll in all, he was playing above his abilities primarily due to strong early connections with Luka. When teams were able to gameplan for him, he is completely neutralized as was evident in the Timberwolves series. He needs to drastically improve his IQ on the defensive side if he wants more playing time. It's OK if you are not the fastest/biggest/strongest guy on the floor IF you have good bball IQ and know where to position yourself, whether that position is to contest a shot, setup to rebound, or hedge and cutoff a driving lane.",

        "body": "**Redick’s Small-Ball Commitment**\n\nJJ Redick loves small ball—he wants to go fast, space the floor, and shoot a lot of threes. His most-used regular season lineup was Luka | Reaves | DFS | Rui | LeBron—the same five that played the entire second half of Game 4 and started Game 5. Redick was always going to gravitate toward that look.\n\n———\n\n**The Hayes Dilemma**\n\nNothing changed with Jaxson Hayes. He’s been the same player all season. Against a bigger team like Minnesota, the typical small-ball strategy is to counter with speed. It worked to some degree—L.A. won Game 2, held even on rebounds, and led in blocks through the first three games.\n\nRedick said the plan was to match Hayes’ minutes with Gobert’s, and early on it helped limit Gobert’s impact—he was contained, even neutralized, through the first four games. But despite holding Gobert in check, the Lakers were still losing. As the series slipped away, Redick abandoned the minutes-matching and leaned fully into small ball from the second quarter of Game 4 onward.\n\n———\n\n**Why Hayes Got Benched**\n\nHayes struggled to start each half, which caused Redick to lose trust. When Hayes sat, the small-ball lineups would go on runs and Gobert still looked ineffective. This reinforced the idea that Hayes was hurting them.\n\nAdvanced stats backed it up—Hayes looked like a liability. Per 36 numbers told a more forgiving story, but ultimately, the advanced metrics—and the eye test—pushed Redick away from him.\n\nThe truth is, no stat tells the whole story. We use data to fill in gaps with educated guesses. What the numbers didn’t show was what would happen if Hayes didn’t play at all.\n\nGame 5 gave us that answer.\n\n———\n\n**The Gobert Chain Reaction**\n\nDespite the numbers, Hayes’ presence changed how the Wolves used Gobert. At 7’0 and athletic, Hayes was enough of a deterrent to limit Gobert’s role. Finch clearly adjusted when Hayes was on the floor.\n\nOnce it became clear in Game 5 that Hayes wouldn’t play, Finch went all-in on Gobert—and that was that. Gobert dominated, and it was curtains.",

    "selftext": "I don't feel like this season was a championship-or-bust year for them. Of course it's very disappointing to see him bow out of the playoffs so early, but I just don't think there was any way Luka and Lebron on their own were enough to make an impact out west. \n\nThe center spot is not a hole for them; it is a crater caused by a nuke. Chuck made an interesting point that JJ Redick trusted Maxi Kleiber (who hadn't played since late Jan due to injury) more than he trusted Jaxon Hayes. Lebron is slowing down. But him, Luka, Reaves, DFS, and Rui are going to be on the team next year. Outside of them, I feel like everybody else is fair game in trade talks. It's going to be a long summer for them in trying to figure out how to surround the team with the right talent to make a legit run to the finals before Lebron hangs it up within the next 2-4 years.

I don't imagine the Timberwolves were going to have to change their plans because they don't have to worry about Hayes anymore. \n\nAnd yes, Hayes has been completely ineffective. He's not giving anything on offence, he's not giving any sort of strong resistance inside and he's getting spanked on the boards. Better to have someone who can do at least one of those things, or can switch onto a small more effectively. Makes it easier when Minnesota don't use Gobert much on offence, because the one thing you might want is a taller defender in the post if that was a strategy.",

Look at the game logs towards the end of his season. 21 and 14 in a win against the Bucks. 22 and 15 against the Heat. 25 and 20 in an OT revenge game win against Phoenix. \n\nIt will be interesting to see what kind of Ayton shows up in 2025-2026. Motivated Ayton is borderline All-Star material. Coasting Ayton is still an automatic double double. 7 seasons in the NBA and 7 seasons of averaging a double double. He's been a small bust relative to expectations, but he's still probably an above average starter at the 5. \n\nCould be a Moneyball pick up on his next contract if a team can get consistent high effort out of him.

It's a consistency and effort thing with him. When he buys in and plays hard, he's borderline All-Star level. The Pacers have good culture and development.

And while he is an athletic specimen, some players are faster, some players are bigger, some players have a higher vertical.   \n\nAusur is probably the most gifted athlete all time from a physical stature \n\nJordan isn't far behind, if at all.  His wingspan is only about an inch shorter than Lebron's, I'm taking his vertical leap, hand size, and speed over Lebron's physical stature and athletic traits for the 2\n\n\nI give Lebron the 3 over KD, although it was VERY close in my mind.  He's so long for a 3, but you'd take the additional speed and athleticism at this position\n\nGiannis has my physique of a 4.  Just long for days, really quick, and extremely coordinated at his size.  \n\nUnicorn center gets the 5, while he may not have the ideal mass I do think the more a 5 can do away from the basket and recover to guard the rim is the most valuable archetype for a modern day 5.  He has all the physical traits to accomplish this",

There are more available to you the taller you are at point for sure, but the first and foremost thing is can you create the advantage and get by your man.\n\nAmen can certainly do that, but he’s not really a passer like that so it’s just weird to shoehorn him in here",

He also averaged 7 assists, 4-5 rebs, 2 steals.  He was 6'7\" at the point, wiry, and could leap like a deer.  I'm not kidding, if you have ever seen a deer leap, that's what Penny looked like.  He had great handles and court vision but could also get off his own shot anytime he needed.  It's a damn shame he got injured shortly after Shaq departed Orlando because he definitely could've developed into an ATG.  \n\nSaying all this, I don't think he was ever better than Jordan, not even after Jordan's brief baseball stint.

I’m talking about guys who were praised like gods at the time but maybe didn’t really live up to it — whether it was because of team context, media hype, or just empty stats.\n\nHere’s how I’d break it down by era — feel free to roast me or add your own:\n\n\t•\t80s – James Worthy? Great player, sure, but did playing with Magic and Kareem inflate his legacy?\n\n\t•\t90s – Penny Hardaway? Insane potential, but did we crown him too early before the injuries?\n\n\t•\t2000s – Vince Carter? Highlights for days, but did he really ever lead a contender?\n\n\t•\t2010s – Carmelo Anthony? Buckets, yeah, but how often did his style actually help teams win?\n\n\t•\t2020s (so far) – Trae Young? Stats look crazy but the efficiency and defense… yikes.\n\nNot saying I’m right on all these, but I wanna hear what y’all think. Who’s the most overrated player of each era in their prime hype window? Not “they’re overrated now” — I mean at the time, they were treated like gods.\n\nLet’s hear some hot takes.",

Decent all-star player for a few years. Double double machine for that span, injuries and conditioning dropped off. My friends thought he was one of the five best players in the league because he could dunk. Younger fans thought he was a transcendent talent. Was a non-factor in Cleveland, except the year he got hurt (I felt bad for him). Penny was not overrated - he had injury issues. He was awesome before he fell apart.\n\n2000s: Stephon Marbury. Another guy everyone thought might be a transcendent talent. I remember Magic Johnson thanking him on air for \"bringing excitement back to New York\" when he got traded to the Knicks. He had a ho-hum NBA career for such a heralded talent, with 2 all-star appearances and very little playoff success. Vince Carter actually had a terrific career, especially early on. 8 all-star appearances, and he played for a loooooooooong time. Had some really great playoff series, too.\n\n2010s: Zach LaVine. Another overrated Minnesota Timberwolves flashy guard. Nice player in the right circumstances. Not a difference maker. Sacto still traded for him. Carmelo Anthony had pretty good career. Too many buckets, and just enough playoff series to be credible. But man... he never put it together at all on the defensive end. I will say that much.\n\n2020s: De'Aaron Fox. At this point he has 1 all-star appearance and a track record of futility. He's declined on both ends since that lone all-star game, too, and is back to playing matador defense. Trae Young, for all his faults, can really light people up. I think he'll be ok. A lot of all-star appearances already, too.",

I'm just 19 and I haven't seen highlights of Dantley tbh, so don't take this one very seriously\n\n90s: Larry Johnson. He was super hyped, no.1 overall pick that only was an All-Star twice, had one All-NBA selection and played just 10 years in the league, although it was due to back problems. Other than him I'd like to mention the Run-TMC Warriors, they were too much fanfare and zero results. Chris Mullin was great though\n\n00s: The easy pick is Vince Carter. And people are right to call him overrated cause he was. But I'd also like to throw Steve Francis. He killed the Vancouver Grizzlies because of his ego and he got karma by essentially being a bust for his entire career. Edit: holy crap, I forgot Stephon Marbury, he's surely the no.1 most overrated of this decade\n\n10s: Has to be DeMarcus Cousins. He basically had 3 years of great basketball.

Bigger names would be guys like Iverson and Kobe but they aren’t nearly as universally overrated as they used to be, and many underrate them both now as well. Francis, Marbury.. could go Vince or T-Mac but I don’t see many people actually overrating them, Melo is one but pretty much everyone says he’s overrated so I’m not sure who’s actually overrating him at this point. I’m going to go with a more “random” choice and say **Antoine Walker** it’s not like people ever considered him “great” but he’s one of the least impactful players I’ve ever watched that people considered “good”. \n\n**2010s - Derrick Rose** - No player in league history has been more overrated at any given moment than D-Rose was. \n\n**2020s - Kawhi Leonard** - This is somewhat of an odd one because 2020 isn’t really his “era”.. but every time this man has a good game there is 20 threads created here trying to discuss his All-Time ranking.. the odd thing about it is if people truly viewed him as great as they say he is it shouldn’t really be so “shocking” when he has a good game. It should be expected, and that play should occur from him a lot more frequently than it has over the years. Kawhi is a great player, when healthy one of the best two-way players ever, but he’s consistently shoved into convos with players who have been better than him, for longer than him, much much much more consistently than him. It’s not as much that his ability gets overrated it’s that how little that is expected of him completely disrespects players he’s mentioned with.",

    "selftext": "Very often, starters are chosen based on a need for a specific use case their team needs (talking role players here). For example, your typical 3 and D player that only plays defense and post up on the 3-point line. Or, is started who is only brought in for their defense but isn't relied upon to score practically any night. Your Moses Moodys, your Jared Vanderbilts or Hardaway Jr. (I am not saying these guys are the worst necessarily)\n\nContrast this with being the best bench player, who typically comes in when your Superstar player is resting. This player has an entirely different responsibility placed on his shoulders, and typically is expected to perform at a high level AND score. Pritchard, maybe McBride, Naz Reid, guys like that. \n\nSo, what's more desirable? Would you rather be a Moses Moody, or a Peyton Pritchard?",

Penny was no slouch, but Kobe was just better.\n\nBasically... When you don't oversimplify it...Kobe was a MUCH better scorer, defender, rebounder, and leader. Penny willingly allowed Shaq to be \"the man\", whereas Kobe knew he was equally if not More capable of being \"the man\", evident by him leading the team (and league) in 4th quarter scoring, nearly matching Shaq in points (the 2nd and 3rd titles) and then leading the Lakers to 2 More after Shaq left.",

    "title": "Indiana Pacers Free Agency: Top priority remains re-signing Myles Turner according to Rick Carlisle",
    "selftext": "“I don’t think it’s any secret that for the franchise, at this particular moment, that is the No. 1 priority,” Carlisle said of re-signing Turner. “I don’t know anything about money or numbers or years or any of that kind of stuff, but Myles is a very important part of what we’ve done here, what we’ve been doing. He’s a very important part of the history of the franchise, certainly over the last decade.”\n\n“We constantly are sending each other clips of how we can be better in pick-and-roll, how I can help him, how he can help me, whatever the case is,” Haliburton said during the Finals. “… I always thought in my career I was going to be best with a guy who plays above the rim and a pick-and-roll lob threat. Now having experience playing with Myles so long. I feel like he unlocks a lot of what I do.”\n\nThe combination of outside shooting and rim protection out of your center, or anyone, was something that reached the same totals of 3-pointers and blocks in a single playoff run in NBA history, even with his 3-point shot not falling in the final two rounds. OKC changed its starting lineup to go away from their double big lineup before Game 1 in part because of the challenges that Turner presents when guarded by another center. He’s not a perfect player, but he’s certainly impactful. \n\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/ipacers.bsky.social/post/3lsfmwd2i5k23",

However, I just think it's tough to actually pull the trigger on that right now because that would mean the correct move would also be trading siakam and this is just too weird of an ending to do that.

Bringing everyone back was going to incur luxury taxes, right? But ownership indicated that they were willing to spend. Now that they might be out of contention for 1-2 seasons, do they maintain the roster for his return or start retooling early?\n\nMyles Turner's expected salary was going to cause issues... do they re-sign him anyway? He pairs with Siakam extremely well as his ability to stretch the paint. Do they have their own picks as well? They can also soft tank the year and get a lotto pick if they do, right?\n\nWhat are their options, and what direction do you think they go?",

This whole playoff run, I’ve been wondering if they try to make a bigger move for a borderline star wing with a package based around some combination of Mathurin/Nesmith/McConnell/Toppin/Walker + picks. I don’t know who it would be, but it could be worth it if it’s someone about to hit their prime or early in their prime. Maybe Trey Murphy? My guess is they would happily move off of Mathurin and Nesmith for someone of that caliber.",

In a 30 team comp, it's nearly impossible to put a team together and win in a one shot effort. And especially when they got so close, they have to consider their best chance is behind Haliburton.\n\nWhich means this season is largely going to be about next season. Trying to move trade pieces around will be a part of it to identify things they can improve. But they also have a chance to look at developing players who otherwise might not have had the experience. And whilst they might not get a really high pick with the sort of slide down the standings we expect, if they miss the playoffs they're not only a chance of snaring something of consequence, but they'll definitely get access to better rookie talent no matter what.

I suspect PS will go back to playing a more ISO heavy style, and the team will play at a slower pace with Nemhard as a lead ball handler.  It will be interesting.  I can't see them letting go of the rope.  They still have some talent, and they have tough-minded players who have been willing to buy in.  On the other hand, I don't think they have a roster that can play the style that made them good and I think that is often a recipe for disaster.",

    "selftext": "He's not using him the same way as he did in the regular season, and it's messing up their offense.\n\nSome numbers:\n\n- In the playoffs, in games where Hartenstein has 2+ assists, OKC is **12-1** (and the one loss was in overtime)\n\n- When he has <2 assists, OKC is **3-6**\n\n- Compare that to his numbers in the regular season where he averaged 3.8 assists\n\n- I'm using assists as a proxy for \"how much of the offense flows through him\", but even just looking at number of touches, in the playoffs he's averaging 34.7 touches per game, compared to 55.9 in the regular season\n\n\nHis plus minus on the series isn't great, but if he's not getting the ball, then it's hard to blame him for that. In today's game, he was a -12, but anyone who watched could see how well he played in the 3rd quarter before Daigneault inexplicably took him off.\n\nThe argument for not playing him as much in this series would be for defensive matchup reasons, which I could understand if at minimum Mark would try Hartenstein on Turner and Chet on Siakam, Siakam would obviously cook Hartenstein but that's what Mark insists on. And even with this bad matchup, they've still won every game this series where he played > 20 minutes.\n\nThe Pacers have been amazing and I'm rooting for them, but Hartenstein deserves better than this.",

I don’t know how many times this occurred but that’s usually a good way to use him in an indirect action, taking what the defense gives you. They shouldn’t force feed him though but SGA definitely should take what the defense gives him at times too rather than forcing things, since I saw some really silly turnovers today. ",

He should have tried a few things early or rather stuck with them to see.\n\nBut underrated aspect of losing game 1 is the limited experimenting you can do because you are completely on the backfoot. The Thunder have never had much freedom to feel out lineups and adjustments because they've been in must-wins since game 1. \n\nMaybe he could have explored smaller lineups more in game 3 to see if the trade offs were worth it? Maybe test out more J-Will early? Though a Thunder fan pointed out he's too slow for this series. \n\nAll that to say, you're right. Its done now and the likeky outcome is still a Thunder win.

You simply cannot be this bad when your star player goes to the bench and still make it this far.\n\nEven when Haliburton isn't scoring, he's the driving force for their entire offense. They simply do not function at the same level with him out because they can't create the same advantages possession by possession.

    "selftext": "\n**Knicks:** Brunson, KAT, Bridges, Hart, Anunoby, etc\n\n**Cavs:** Mitchell, Garland, Mobley, Alllen, Okoro, etc\n\n**Indy:** Hali, Siakam, Turner, Nesmith, Nembhard, Toppin, etc\n\nThese 3 teams (not ordered) are probably the best in terms of talent on paper, health for next season, and cohesion. \n\nCeltics is down with Tatum out. Bucks will be down with Dame injury, and Giannis situation. \n\nThe one who can be argued are Pistons. As they are in the same tier (6th and 7th seed) this season.\n\nBut I think after the Bane trade, Magic might be the 4th best team in the East for next season. \n\n**Magic:** Paolo, Franz, Bane, Suggs, Black, WCJ,  Goga\n\nPS: Ofc, A lot can happen in the draft and FA. Other East teams might go all in because they feel that it is their golden chance because Celtics and Bucks are hurt. But for now, Magic might be the 4th best team in the East. Arguably or possibly 3rd if Paolo/Franz/Bane co exist, and one of the top 3 teams above fell.\n\n\n\n\n",

And could the Sixers bounce back with a healthy off-season + top 3 rookie?\n\nIf we're talking specifically right now? We should be viewed as Top 4, but I know it's not as easy as that though.

If he catches fire, OKC can turn things around. He won't have another game under 30\n\nANOTHER REASON IS the Thunder’s Resilience They had the best regular-season record (68-14) and have bounced back from EVERY SINGLE TIME.\n\nWhile Indiana has closed out games well, Tyrese Haliburton is done If OKC tightens up defensively, they can exploit this.\n\nGame 5 at Home If they lose Game 4, they’ll return to Oklahoma City for Game 5, where they’ve been dominant all season and the crowd will be loud asf and that will motivate them\n\nShai always talks about how the playoffs are a game of math, HE WONT CARE HE KNOWS ITS FIRST TO 4 AND WILL GIVE IT HIS ALL, ALL 3 GAMES",

Unless it gets worse I'm sure he'll go on Friday but I am really hoping this doesn't turn into a Suns situation where the whole team gets sick deep into the playoffs. I thought the short turnaround might benefit the Pacers but maybe not if there's a bug going around.        \n      \nI am so sorry I doubted you Myles, I am here to atone        \n      \n[Source](https://bsky.app/profile/fantasynbanews.bsky.social/post/3lreyw77nqc2x)",

But I'm just in awe of how calm and composed they are, no matter what happens. Now I can't say I remember every single moment in the finals so far, but this is like the least frustrated/emotional finals team I've seen in years. From the starters to the bench, no fuss, no complaints, work the ball, chase the lead, focus on the next possession or the next game, W or L. \n\nI guess what I'm saying is, Pacers' mental conditioning is no joke. Credit ro Carlise and the veterans in the team like Siakam and Turner for setting the tone. Composure enables perseverance and maybe that's a considerable part of why Pacers are ahead against a team that is objectively better.  ",

    "selftext": "Pacers won game 1 after an insane 15 point comeback early in the fourth quarter. They overcame an extremely low win probability to upset OKC on the road with a Hali game winner with 0.3 seconds remaining. The Thunder then ultimately failed to score on the final possession of the game. \n\nOkc were largely controlling the game from what I saw, althoughI admittedly fell asleep and missed the midway part of the 4th, but watched the final 3 minutes.\n\nI intially expected okc to dominate and win in 5, but this game has changed my view. I still think okc will win, but in 6, and I’m much more open to the possibility of the Pacers winning.\n\nBeyond the jokes of them having magic, they are clearly a team conditioned to win in any circumstance, which highlights the resilience and confidence level of their team, which is led by Hali and Siakam.\n\nI thought OKC’s decision to not start IHart waa confusing. I’m not sure why the favoured team felt it was necessary to make a lineup adjustment when they had been dominating with their previous lineup that included IHart in the playoffs up to the finals.\n\nI imagine it was due to OKC’s fear of IHart being killed in space, but OKC suffered with just Chet against Turner in the starting unit minutes.\n\nTurner adequately defended Chet inside, whilst also not being eviscerated on the perimeter by him, which was helped by Chet’s disappointing shooting performance. \n\nI also found it confusing that Mark benched both Chet and IHart in the closing minutes as Okc were then playing without a big man in those critical minutes.\n\nThis move potentially compromises them on the boards and also removes the lob threat to a great extent, which is a key aspect of OKC’s offense. \n\nJDub was also poor, but I think he’s proven he can elevate in pivotal games so I think he’ll be fine in this series.\n\nJDub and Chet need to play better, but a concern for Okc and an encouraging sign for the Pacers is that the Pacers won despite recording 19 turnovers this game.\n\nI know Okc’s elite defense tends to force a lot of turnovers, but the Pacers ball security is normally much better and I think that’s something they will tighten up going forward.\n\nHali was also below his best despite the incredible game winner, as he wasn’t overly aggressive in terms of scoring, which is something he needs to work on.\n\nHe’s shown he can do it in games throughout this playoff run though so I think he will have some big games in terms of scoring and playmaking.\n\nShai was fantastic so nothing to really criticise him about. He just needs to keep playing like that. \n\nWhat did you guys think of the game?",

The Pacers can hang with the Thunder on both ends of the court and have the personal to match whatever type of lineup the Thunder put out there. \n\nI said the Pacers have a punchers chances at winning this because they are so explosive offensively while being a solid defence. This game also showed me they can win a lower scoring affair with non of their stars going off. Yes the Thunder turned them over 19/18 times in the first half they also only turned the Pacers over five times in the second half, once the Pacers got used to their pressure. Unlike every other team the Thunder have faced you can’t cheat off of any of the Pacers and they have better depth than the Thunder so overwhelming and warring the down isn’t really an option the same way it was against the Nuggets or Wolves especially. It’s hard to play such a taxing style of defence where guys are flying all over when the opponents just keep coming at you and you can’t miss a close out. \n\nI want the Pacers to win and this game is a big boost for their odds of winning the series. I think it’s closer to 60/40 70/30 for the Thunder where as before I think most people viewed at 90/10 or higher for the Thunder. \n\nEveryone saying oh JDUB and Chet just had a bad night clearly haven’t watched the Pacers at all this run. They are going let SGA go 1 on 1 a ton and see what he can do while the shut down everyone else. While SGA scored a bunch had a pretty average and needs to be more efficient for the Thunder to win. 38 points in 38 scoring attempts isn’t great. They already got the Dort game too.",

I’m not overreacting based on one game though. \n\nUltimately, I think OKC will still win, but it needs to be said that Rick Carlisle is an immensely underrated coach. He’s been the best coach in every series the Pacers have played this postseason, and I think that remains true here. \n\nGame 2 will tell a lot. If OKC wins in dominant fashion like they did against Denver, I’ll feel comfortable staying with my “thunder in 6” prediction. Personally, I think they’ll adjust and this will be the result. But if Indiana plays them in a tight game—or even wins—anything could happen. \n\nI will say, a loss like this in the finals is devastating, so there is a question mark about how a group of young, inexperienced players will handle it. ",

        "body": "This game was worst case scenario for OKC and they are going to have to make some big adjustments to win the series. \n\nThe pacers mostly played SGA straight up and were very disciplined about staying in front and not fouling. SGA took advantage and had a great performance, but the supporting cast outside Dort catching fire from three really struggled and the offense as a whole struggled. Pacers will continue to live with SGA scoring 35-45 on good efficiency so long as they’re holding OKC as a team to 110-115ish points. OKC needs to find a non-SGA pressure point to force pacers to adjust defensively. \n\nOn the other end, it took two and a half quarters for the pacers to get comfortable with OKCs swarming defense. Pacers played rushed and left the ball exposed and OKC pounced on it early in the game. OKC was very good at getting back quick and getting in front of that first rush that the pacers carved NYK apart with. But by the second half Pacers got used to it and then waited for the swarm and reset the offense to attack away from the pressure and the suddenly you look up and they scored 66 in the second half. \n\nIdk what the adjustment for OKC is here except to hope the pacers start missing open threes. Other people in this thread pointed it out but thunder thrive on keying in on the primary ball handler/offensive hub and then recovering away from him. But the pacers swap their offensive hub multiple times a possession and are comfortable running the offense through just about everyone in the lineup.",

        "body": "I think in the fourth quarter, Rick Carlisle/Pacers figured out the OKC defensive rotation pattern.  The two baseline defenders come up to the midrange to meet the perimeter defenders and suffocate the shot, with the center moving through the paint to force the ball back out.\n\nLook at Haliburton's last shot.  He drives through the perimeter and gets to about 17' from basket.  His defender, I think Jalen, sags off of him, and then caruso comes up from the paint to defend the shot. In between Jalen leaving and Caruso coming, Hali can gather and shoot, and it's good.\n\nIND truly exploited this in the last two minutes of the game by working 1 on 1 beyond the perimeter or doing quick trigger releases from the 15-17' range.  None of the teams that OKC had played in the playoffs could do this yet.  Denver could go beyond the perimeter, and the one game that Denver just killed OKC, they did it with MPJ going super-saiyan from midrange.  Carlisle definitely saw that film and made it work.\n\nI'm going to guess we see OKC go back to starting two centers in the next game, and switch the closing 2-3 zone to a 3-2 zone with Williams playing the Rover, and using Chet/Hart as the two inside.  If that doesn't work, or if OKC proves uncomfortable playing it, I think Indiana turned this series into a coinflip.",

        "body": "The Thunder are pretty easy to figure out. Their defense is elite, partially because they are allowed to be significantly more physical than their opponents, and partially because they help and recover unlike any team I’ve ever seen. So those are the two biggest factors in the series to me. How is the whistle (I bet it’s more favorable for them in game 2), and how many open 3s are Toppin/Shepherd/Mathurin/Nesmith going to hit. In all of their Western Conference series, OKC could swarm and swarm until the ball found a non-shooter so open that they had to take it. Indy doesn’t have any non-shooters in their rotation. \n\nI kind of liked Indy even before game 1 specifically because of how they move the ball. OKC absolutely smothers the hub of your offense (Jokic/Ant), and then closes out like maniacs to shooters. But it’s all predicated on one guy being the focal point and containing him with length, physicality, and help. Indy is the exact opposite of that. They have shooters everywhere, and their offense is free-flowing. There isn’t one guy to choke off (Hali is awesome but he doesn’t play like that). \n\nBoth teams have opportunities to be better in transition. It’s driving me crazy to watch all these teams play OKC, grab a defensive rebound and immediately start dribbling without realizing Dort/Caruso/Wallace are waiting for you to do that so they can take it. If Indy tightens that up, they can easily win the series. OKC didn’t capitalize on the metric ton of turnovers they forced, and that’s a problem for them. Aside from the 1-2 Jalen Williams games they’ll get, their half-court offense is Shai and a bunch of hot garbage. They don’t have much more upside to tap into there, while I feel like Indy does. \n\nI fully trust Indy/Carlisle/Hali to clean up the turnovers, and if they do that, I think OKC’s half-court offense is too limited to counter-punch. That said, we could see Shea turn in to 06 Wade in the finals and all of this will be moot.",

This also showed the experience of Carlisle when he benched the starters early in the 4th, and the Pacers began to play better ball. It was his way of telling his boys to wake up because if they don't wake up now they'll lose the game.\n\nThe Pacers MUST be more careful with the ball. OKC might've let this one slip, but if they learn from their mistakes then game 2 won't be as pretty for the Pacers. As for OKC they MUST learn how to hold a lead. They had the Pacers all the way until when it mattered the most. They squandered a guaranteed win.\n\nOKC should also take less 3s and keep getting points in the paint. They had 46 points from the paint, yet they shot only 37% from downtown. The Pacers had 7 more made threes, yet only won by 1. So imagine if OKC takes more missed 3s away and converts them into easy 2s. The game could've been an easy double digit victory in favor of OKC. The obsession with 3s in this league drives me mad. It only works IF you have excellent 3 point shooters. If you don't, then don't make the 3 a focal point of the game. If the team can shoot well inside, keep going for those 2s.\n\nReally, OKC lost because of themselves; not because of the Pacers. They have to play smarter ball if they have a chance of winning this series.",

Thunder hasn't been a great shooting team this post season and this series is exactly where that will cost them. Their defense was their usual self but pacers never felt overwhelmed and just did their thing. This is my second biggest reason for why I think Pacers will win this series,  they are mentally tougher than thunder and they've been through this situation multiple times in the series. You see west series and thunders opponents just gave up or got flustered when thunder played those suffocating defense and increased their lead off of the turnovers but Pacers stayed resilient. Pacers took away their home court advantage and that's one of thunders main weapon. \n\nMy number 1 reason for picking pacers however is Carlisle. He is an elite coach and I think he can run circles around Diagneault during crunch time. Diagneault is not a bad coach by any means but Rick has so much more experience which will be a great factor.\n\nWill Pacers shoot what felt like 100% during that one stretch to come back into the game? Probably not (but how many times we've said that before). Will Jdub and Chet play that poorly again? Maybe, but likely not. But all thing considered, this is gonna be a game of great defense- ok shooting vs patience and great shooting/execution and the latter will thrive.",

Also multiple possessions where he dribbled the ball maybe a pass to someone else who passed it right back for the first about 18 seconds of the clock then leaving one of his teammates with the ball with 6 seconds or less as he just fades away beyond the 3 point line. I know this probably sounds to critical of the guy but they lost by 1 point and any additional made basket wins them that game.\n\n\nA few Pacers shot great Toppin and Nemhard. Turner made timely shots. Obviously Hali's game winner. But the biggest strategic thing for me going into this series was Pascal Siakam. If Siakam is the biggest guy on the court I thought he would have a field day. Some claimed J Williams would be covering him but to he isn't big enough. Now I thought that would be fine because Chet would be playing help D or Hartenstein would be there for rebounding. These guys only played 24 and 17 minutes respectively. If Siakam is allowed to play as the biggest guy on the court he will be a problem for the Thunder.",

        "body": "What's really sticking out to me about the Pacers is that they put 5 guys on the court who not only buy into the system, but like the Thunder, play team defense, move their feet, cover open space quickly, and there are really no \"targetable\" defenders on this team, especially not on their starting 5.  Haliburton has been a better defender via both the eye test and the numbers this year, as he is a + guy in both DBPM and has the best DRTG of his career this season.\n\nAre they the kind of 5 man elite swarming defense like the Thunder?  Perhaps not, but we can see the Thunder *do* have some concerning points to their style of defense, namely the open corner 3s.  I don't think it's an aberration that the Pacers shot such a high % from deep in game 1, many of those shots were uncontested or at best partially contested.  If you go back and look at the scoring opportunities for Indy, especially in the 2nd half, you notice OKC defenders almost *constantly* cheating toward the paint, hoping to use their size and movement to get out to cover the 3s, but Indy's passing is elite as a unit and the passes are hitting their men who immediately fire the shot with ample space.  The corner 3 is a high percentage look, being the shortest 3 point shot on the floor, so it'll be interesting to see if the Thunder make a conscious decision to stop that cheat in on the gaps and open more driving lanes to take away the 3.\n\nDespite Indy's turnover issues in the first half, they are continually impressive about moving the ball and using passes to hurt defenses that gamble.  As elite as the Thunder are about recovery, *any* help defense, be it through a hard double, soft double, hedge, or cheat, is a gamble, and Indy seems to know how to punish that.\n\nDaigneault has to find an answer for a few problems:\n\n1.  Indy's incredible 3 point shooting\n\n2.  Indy's passing, which can carve up defenses\n\n3.  Indy's daunting rebounding advantage in game 1\n\n4.  Indy's ability to operate outside of Haliburton orchestrating the offense at the point of attack (off-ball), which removes OKC's best defender from being on-ball and bottling up the open passing.\n\nI suspect Daigneault might opt to help less on dribble drive penetration and also have defenders stay home a bit more, which theoretically will give more opportunities for Indiana attackers to break down the defender in a 1 on 1 situation with less help available.\n\nThe particularly concerning thing is that OKC needs to solve both the rebounding problem and also the open 3 issue.  That's a tough ask because we saw Hartenstein having difficulty with spacing when he was on the court, and if they glue him to the perimeter, it's going to remove his ability to be a rebounding force and restrict his help defense on drives.\n\nOKC is an elite team that will likely be able to make the adjustment, but they do have some problems to solve.  You can't continue to help on every drive while also having 100% recovery rate to the wings *and* the top of the key, something has to give.  And Indy's fluid offense gives a lot of rein to any guy they put on the court to fire away.",

They are going let SGA go 1 on 1 a ton and see what he can do while the shut down everyone else. While SGA scored a bunch had a pretty average and needs to be more efficient for the Thunder to win. 38 points in 38 scoring attempts isn’t great.\n\nThis is exactly right. I said something similar in [one of the pre-series threads in this sub earlier this week](https://np.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/1l0jqwh/things_to_watch_for_in_the_nba_finals_thunder_vs/mvg0kpn/): \"They're going to play their usual defense and trust their perimeter defenders to force SGA into tough looks and they'll live with the results. They'd rather let SGA average 42 a game for the whole series and limit open looks for role players than 'limit' SGA and get crushed by role players.\"\n\nAnd we saw that last night. SGA will get his, but they won't be easy looks. Nembhard and Nesmith are both very good on-ball perimeter defenders. The Pacers are simply not going to overhelp and leave their weakside defenders in a lose-lose spot. If JDub is going to have big games this series, it will be because he hits incredibly tough shots or because he simply beats his guy one-on-one. Same with Chet.\n\nIt's going to be SGA iso ball all series long, just like it was with Brunson in the NYK series, Mitchell in the CLE series and Giannis in the MIL series. The Pacers simply won't put themselves in scramble mode all day long, they're going to live with their perimeter defenders on an island and trust them to do well enough.",

    "title": "[Matt Moore] Free Agency And Draft Rumors: Panic At The Workouts",
    "selftext": "https://substack.com/home/post/p-164878003\n\n\nTHE ACE BAILEY CONVO\n\n> The Sixers are sending out mixed signals about that third pick. I’ve heard they’re willing to move it for a star upgrade, want to keep it, and are fine with taking Ace Bailey, and that they are not fans and may take VJ Edgecombe instead. All options are obviously on the table for a team in their position. So that clears that up.\n\n\n\n> Fears crushed interviews and workouts around the combine and made a big jump. I don’t think that was agent-created; he genuinely jumped. I don’t think Fears gets past Wizards at six unless something dramatic happens.\n\n> I get the sense that consensus is still behind a little bit on Queen who I think has enjoyed more of a bump from draft process than has been reported. However, one draft consultant told me there are enough holes in his game where he might fall back as it gets closer to the actual draft.\n\n> Khaman Maluach is still getting a fair amount of hype, but some teams were confident this week he’d be in range in the last five picks of the lottery.\n\n> Jase Richardson has picked up steam and I think is closer to 10 than 20 right now, but anywhere in that range sounds right.\n\n\n\nFree Agency\n\n> Orlando is indeed shifting its approach, as it sounded like in their postseason pressers, towards making major upgrades. Sources believe they are looking to package around $25 million in salary for various players to give the offense the jump it needs. That sounds right because with Franz and Paolo, any addition making above that likely will demand the ball too much.\n\n> This is outside speculative, but two different East personnel figures believe that the Bulls are unlikely to retain both Josh Giddey and Coby White. If Giddey gets locked in, White could be moved. I’m skeptical of that idea because that sounds like a radical concept for the Bulls and that doesn’t sound like them. Saving money sounds like them, but not like this.\n\n> Multiple Lakers outlets have reported on “theoretical” trades involving Nets center Nic Claxton, and that’s not a coincidence. Claxton provides an athletic veteran floor runner who can switch to put next to Luka, the Nets and Lakers have done deals before, multiple times, and Claxton is likely ready to be on a contending team. If this move happens, the Lakers are going to be way better than what the surface analysis on this kind of move would indicate. He’s good.\n\n> The Suns have indicated to teams that center is at a premium for them in any KD talks. He might stick around, but their biggest interest is in solving the center position, which has been a disaster since moving on from Ayton.\n\n> I was really curious what the Pacers were going to do given that they couldn’t clear salary for Myles Turner’s extension at the deadline, but it sounds like, regardless, he’s not going anywhere. Word is that the two sides are already close on an extension that will keep him with Indiana. What that means for the rest of the Pacers supporting cast is another question.\n\n> The Clippers are hunting for a name. Some superstars (older ones), some veteran guys with championship experience. They really think they can make another run at it, which is very much looking at the gift horse of this season in the mouth.",

First we started losing a lot. Then suddenly my name was popping up in trade rumors a lot — and that’s not even anything bad, you know? Very few guys will ever be good enough at hooping to become an NBA trade asset. That’s a high as hell level to reach. But it definitely took a toll on my mental health. I’d see stuff on social media like, “Myles Turner is a finished product”.......... man. Even if I knew it was only basketball talk, it was still hard to keep it basketball-only in my feelings. And maybe that’s dumb when you’re making millions of dollars to play the game you love. But what can I say? I was young and I’m human. And I’m not ashamed to say I got pretty depressed.\n",

    "selftext": "This series has the potential to be an all-timer. Both of these teams are built similarly regarding their depth and elite coaching. As for things I'm going to be paying close attention to: \n\n1. An extremely fast paced offense vs one of the greatest defensive units of all-time. This is a really difficult thing to analyze on paper because the Pacers haven't seen a defense like OKC's, and the Thunder haven't seen an offense with the pace of the Pacers. For the record, the Thunder were 2-0 vs the Pacers in the regular season - but of course that doesn't carry much weight. \n\n2. The Thunder tend to play a swarming style of defense that leaves shooters open. I'm really interested to see if the Pacers can make them pay for that style of defense and any potential adjustments OKC might have to make. A lot of this series might just boil down to Nesmith, Nembhard, Sheppard, Toppin, etc. ability to shoot and make open 3's. \n\n3. The Siakam match-up. Pascal Siakam is a very unique player to defend. He's around 6'8, and he is a very skilled player. He just had a pretty insane series vs the Knicks in the Eastern Conference Finals. The Thunder start two seven footers, but recently, they have been reducing iHart's minutes. Against the Timberwolves, the Thunder played Chet at center a lot. I would assume, they will probably have a similar strategy vs Myles Turner because he's more of a shooter/face-up big, so Chet at C seems like it will work. That would mean that perhaps JDub is tasked with defending Siakam in this series.\n\n4. Inexperience factor. Unless I'm missing something, I believe only Pascal Siakam and Alex Caruso have NBA Finals experience (both have won a title). It'll be interesting to see how all the other players in this series are able to compartmentalize the pressure of this series and how they perform. \n\nWhat are some things you're looking forward to or find interesting? No matter how small you may think it is, I'm looking forward to reading every post. I'm a Thunder fan and have watched every OKC game this season (and previous seasons). I've watched some Pacers games this season, mostly their two games vs OKC and postseason games. I'm a big fan of how the Pacers play basketball. If they weren't facing the Thunder in the Finals, I would be rooting for Indiana to win the title. ",

They’re the best team in the league at countering what Indiana does well, while also doing that thing better. \n\nMoreover, Indiana is a poor rebounding team. If they turn the ball over a few more times per game than their averages, they will lose the possession game and will have to shoot exceptionally to win. \n\nI see OKC in 5, on the back of their turnover and rebounding advantages.",

He'll probably get first crack at Spicy P. But Pascal will see everyone. \n\nPacers don't turn it over so that will be interesting as we thrive on TOs. But I feel we have the best offensive player in the series and probably the Third, and Forth too. \n\nCarlisle is an elite coach who makes elite adjustments. That will be tough. Clear advantage pacers but Dags is no joke. \n\nPacers are deep and very in tune. This is not the regular season pacers. They are monsters. \n\nI think we make Hali a scorer more than a passer. We manage to do that we're in great shape. But we played the most elite passer in the league so by no means is that a  deal breaker. \n\nAs a Thunder fan I have clear Biases. I think  it'll be a tough series. Tougher than people think. But in the end I think our defence is all time great. Our offensive is probably a bit better. So I think Thunder in 6",

The Pacers handling the Knicks so well with all of their squad healthy/fit to play was a bit of surprise to me and so was the Thunder giving no chance to the Wolves except from that one game. \n\nIt seems that the Thunder play with a bigger sense of urgency which is usually the hallmark of a championship team. They’re creating a ton of opportunities for themselves with their defence and they’re not wasting them. I think this will decide the match-up.",

        "body": "IMHO - some factors that will be seen\n\n\nPace \n-\n\nBoth teams have been playing at a faster pace and projected to have 100+ possessions per game.  OKC  because of the TOs they create and the Pacers because of their focus to pass the ball quickly after rebounds.\n\nThunder are averaging 100.6 possessions per playoff game this season, which ranks second behind only the Memphis Grizzlies, who lost against the Thunder in a first-round sweep. In third place behind OKC is Indiana, with 98.4 possessions per game.\n\nWill OKC crash the boards and hoping they are quick enough to provide great transitional defense or will they designate one player to defend  hence one less player to play free safety on defense \n\n\n\nRefs and Head Coaches\n-\nHow will they call the games and how will the players adjust to the calls.  Will Shai (a great player) get the same calls or fills or will the refs call all the actual calls and not allow any obvious flopping on both teams\n\nWhat will Carlisle do to expose and limit OKC’s aggressive defensive double/triple-teaming?  With the TWolves really only having one, maybe two, legitimate offensive threats - OKC really only has one purpose - stop the 23 years old Ant Man, who doesn’t yet have the maturity/expedience to carry a team aka LeBron\n\nPacers have multiple good to very good offensive threats that will limit double-teams limiting Caruso’s ability to play free safety to cause havoc.  Dort is an excellent defensive player, though limited offensively, how will Carlisle take advantage of that.\n\nCarlisle obviously has the experience advantage, how will this affect this series that will force both to made adjustments \n\n\n\n3 Pt Shooting\n-\n\nOKC is best at defending the 3pt line (Thunder ranked third in opponent 3-point shot quality this regular season (based on factors such as defender distance and shooter identity), and they ranked second in opponent 3-point shot making - actual accuracy minus expected accuracy but they also give up the most 3pt shots (allowed the third-most 3-pointers in the league, per Cleaning the Glass, with 41% of their opponents' shot attempts coming from beyond the arc).\n\nWith TWolves lacking any legitimate and feared shooters, they packed the paint and dared them to shoot.  Pacers have multiple legitimate shooters (Indiana's 40% 3-point accuracy leads all playoff teams by a wide margin, and Haliburton is the only Pacers starter below that mark individually) so “loading up” on any one player will provide more air space for shooters to have cleaner shots\n\n\n\nHalliburton\n-\nWill he play aggressively forcing OKC to make many quick decisions (hence greater chance of winning) or will he play passively (because of his decisions or inexperience/forced by OKC\n\n\n\nChet vs Myles\n-\n\nBoth players cancel the other advantage hence forcing both to explore other ways to exploit weaknesses\n\n\n\nRecent Past\n-\n\nTWolves’ only victory has provided some evidence of what has worked \n\nKnicks provided Indy of playing against a bruising defensive minded team \n\n\n\nPressure\n-\nWith many predicting OKC will win because of their amazing regular season (rightfully so - only four champions in NBA history finished with a better regular-season record than the Thunder: the 1995-96 Bulls (72-10), the 1996-97 Bulls (69-13), the 1971-72 Los Angeles Lakers (69-13) and the 1966-67 Philadelphia 76ers (68-13) ) they have the pressure (even if they do they don’t say it) because last year had many NBA pundits favoring them.  \n\nBoth teams have no experience in the Finals, so this series might continue the trend of huge swings in multiple games\n\n\n\nHistory\n-\nPacers could become the first champion in league history that wasn't either a top-three seed or a defending titlist.\n\nIf OKC win, it should be noted that only four champions in NBA history finished with a better regular-season record than the Thunder: the 1995-96 Bulls (72-10), the 1996-97 Bulls (69-13), the 1971-72 Los Angeles Lakers (69-13) and the 1966-67 Philadelphia 76ers (68-13).\n\nThe 72 win Dubs teams was defeated by LeBron’s Cavs team\n\n\n\nStrengths vs Weaknesses\n-\nWith the #1 defense facing the #2 offense, will this series hinge on the “other side of the court” hence opportunities for a key role/bench player making a critical play to decide a game’s outcome?  That is the beauty of having the game decided on the court.",

Ratings aside, this should be one of the best finals in recent memory from a basketball standpoint. \n\nTwo outstanding, deep teams with very strong but very different identities. After January 1 of this year, these two teams had the 2 best records in the NBA. Every single possession of IND offense vs OKC defense will be pure cinema.\n\nOne thing I’ll be interested to look for: we’ve seen OKC (and other teams) play some extremely aggressive coverages this postseason. To me, the theme of this playoffs has really been selling out to stop the stars at any cost. OKC/DEN series was a great example of this. OKC also did this against Ant. They doubled him on 43% of his front court touches in game 4. \n\nThe question is: will Halliburton be good enough in isolation to force aggressive coverages out of OKC? Hali, more than guys like Ant or Jokic, wants to move the ball. He wants you to double, because he’s a better playmaker than he is scorer. Therefore, OKC may try to force Halliburton to carry the scoring load by limiting doubles but constantly rotating elite perimeter defenders on Hali. OKC did something similar to Denver, forcing them to rely on the 3 ball, which was their biggest offensive weakness.",

        "body": "As a disclaimer I hate both the Thunder and the Pacers. But honestly, as much as I’d like to see a close series, I can’t imagine us getting one.\n\nSiakam is definitely the x-factor; if he’s able to cook his matchup every night, Indy has a chance to win the game. But this Knicks series was hard-fought, it’d be going to game 7 if NY didn’t give game 1 away on a platter; I just imagine inserting like 1-3 of the Thunder’s bench guys into that Knicks roster, and I feel like the series changes drastically. Replace the entire Knicks team with OKC and it’s just hard for me to imagine the Pacers getting a game off of them.\n\nThe main thing is just the bodies. Haliburton has not really had to deal with a great primary defender this postseason; as much as I like the Cavs and Knicks rosters the best poa defender he saw regularly was probably Mikal Bridges, who’s been sub-par this year. The Thunder are gonna have Lu Dort and Alex Caruso fighting over screens to stay on his ass, and they have quick, efficient help rotations with long, young athletes if the primary gets beat. Obviously the Pacers are good at creating open shots but it’s gonna be waaaay harder to do vs OKC. Another reason being that a ton of their open looks are leak-outs, Daigneault will have seen that and noted it; the Knicks legitimately didn’t really have anybody to run down the court with Siakam because of Anunoby’s hamstring, he would try to keep up but it was pretty clear that even off makes, he could beat pretty much the whole team up the floor. OKC has Dort, Caruso, they have both Williams, they have guys like Wallace and Joe, they are going to make things very difficult for Indy in a way that Cleveland and NY just did not have the capability to. Transition points will not come as easily.\n\nPartly to that point, they also take way better care of the ball than either of Indy’s first two matchups, and a lot of that has to do with the fact that they have the MVP leading their team as their point guard. The Pacers did a great job of guarding Brunson and Mitchell, but those are smaller guards than SGA by a good bit, and SGA is just better. He’s not a defensive liability, they can’t really attack him the way they did Brunson or Towns, and Nembhard, Nesmith and the Pacers guys that they liked to throw at Brunson are going to have a way tougher time with SGA because they don’t outsize him, in fact it’s the other way around. Think about how easy it looked for Brunson in 5 out of those 6 games to get to his spots in the mid-range and score even with those guys draped all over him; that’s SGA’s game too, except he’s bigger, stronger, and he’s gonna get more calls than Brunson did.\n\nI can’t count out the Pacers, anything is possible and they’re for sure exceeding expectations this year. But with the way OKC has been playing, it’s really tough for me to imagine a scenario in which they lose a game to Indiana, except maybe if the Pacers get really hot from 3 in one of their home games. The conference gap is just real, OKC’s roster is about as twice as long as NY’s if it has to be and they have younger, more athletic players who are better 3pt shooters; not to mention a man who is basically a 6’6” version of Jalen Brunson. Again, can’t count Indy out, anything is possible, but it’s gonna be tough for them.",

I get it. We all have biases and it is hardly ever objectively discussed. It's also just kind of a bummer to bring something in the discussion that kind of \"ruins\" the discussion of the players, since they are by far the biggest factor. A thorough discussion cannot be had on this topic without discussing the officiating OKC has received throughout the playoffs. \n\nGoing into it, I think the thought process was that their style of defense would hold up well in the playoffs, since more physical play is generally allowed. On offense, I think many expected/hoped that the flopping done by SGA would see decreased effectiveness. That has not been the case. The effect of SGA's embellishment is far greater than him getting a bunch of free throws. I would argue that the free throws are actually the second problem in regards to impact. The biggest thing it does is drastically change how defenders can approach defense against him in general. If marginal contact initiated by SGA is being rewarded consistently, defenders have to back off to where that contact cannot be initiated easily. In the NBA, this extra several inches of cushion that has to be given to do this has a massive impact. Shots are significantly easier to get up. It is a huge factor in the equation, and turning a blind eye to it is not allowing a comprehensive discussion to occur.\n\nSo my position is pretty straightforward. If the officials do not call marginal contact INITIATED by SGA, I think we get a competitive series. Thunder still favored by a decent amount. If we get the same style of officiating that we have up to this point, the Pacers are going to have to shoot the lights out in the series to have a chance.",

He also has quite a bit more NBA experience than his OKC counterpart.\n\nI also don't think Caruso's finals experience is truly comparable to Siakam's, given that it came in the biggest asterisk season in NBA history. No travel and especially no road venues/fans give that finals a different level of difficulty.\n\nThe biggest question I have is whether the Pacers can play at their usual combination of fast pace and low turnovers vs the swarming/fouling OKC defense, or whether said defense will turn them over and get the Thunder the fast breaks they thrive on.\n\nThe 2nd most important question is whether the Pacers defense can get turnovers and fast breaks against the team with the least amount of turnovers in the playoffs.\n\n3rd, can the Pacers keep the rebounding numbers close enough so as to not be a major factor, especially wrt 2nd chance points for OKC?\n\nI think the Thunder will win their 1st title (because that Sonics title doesn't count) but it will likely go 6 games and might even take 7.",

    "selftext": "He's had a very bizarre career.\n\nStarting with the terrible Lakers but getting no playing time, he was eventually traded to the Wizards who he gave a few years as a starter.\n\nDuring these Washington years he was solid on offense, averaging 11/6. He actually led the league in 2P% one year, and shot above 40% from 3 two years. But no one was high on him for a variety of reasons, injury more than any. \n\nThe highlight here was a forgotten Linsanity run in the bubble: He averaged 20/9 with 4 stocks shooting 56/42/79% during this stretch. \n\nHe then signed with the Lakers in FA and spent a very bizarre period as the Lakers sucked, the Westbrook era burned out, and LeBron neared the all-time scoring record. \n\nA month before he was traded he had a 5 game stretch where the Lakers went 5-0, him averaging an absurd 21 and 14 rebounds per game. It was capped off by 29/14 performance for our first win of the season against the very loud light the beam Kings them. \n\nThe Lakers continued to suck after, with his last game with LA being the game LeBron broke the scoring record. He infamously is in the [background](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ttzJR786twT6T3ZA86dcRhEguCM=/1400x788/filters:format(jpeg)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24863758/1246879099.jpg) of his shot to break it, calling for a post-up on Shai. That game ended the morning of February 8th. \n\nOn February 9th, he was traded to the Nuggets. His minutes dwindled and he didn't play in the playoffs, but he won his first ring and the first for Denver, beating the Lakers in the process.\n\nHe signed with the Heat, never really gaining any momentum with them. He was traded in December for a second round pick swap. He has found consistent playing time with Indiana, contributing to some big wins.\n\nThose wins were nothing compared to Myles Turner committing two quick fouls, and Rick Carlisle calling his name. In a crucial period where the game could've went either way based on his performance, he went 3/3 from 3, scoring 11 points in 6 minutes. ",

    "selftext": "Mathurin and Pacers. Such a polarizing subject. Love and hate.\n\nWe've seen the highs and the lows with Mathurin. Recently only the lows... since the Deandre Hunter ejection he's been different. He scored 19 points in very important game 2 win in Cleveland and again 23 points in game 3... then fhe fight took place and he's not the same since. Did someone on the team put him in his place, told him to stop doing stupid plays, make him lose all his confidence? Maybe he feels alineated?  It is just all on him? Supremely inconsistent. This has been frustrating to watch. When he plays well, he is one of my favorite players and brought a lot of edge and fun to what or else would be a very tame Pacers team to watch.\n\nI'm not sure what is going on. Clearly RICK CARLISLE prefers cerebral, High IQ basketball players like HALIBURTON, NEMBHARD ... (all coaches do ) but Mathurin only knows how to play on guts and instincts.... Will run through a wall for you. But only knows one way.  And there is some bad that comes with it. It's a 2 steps forward, one step back kind of thing with Mathurin.\n\nIt's a choice. Either sit him on the bench and only play him 10 and 8 minutes like you did the last 2 games and take ALL his confidence away. Or empower him. Give him confidence and get the player that averaged 19 points a game against the Knicks this year.... Conversely, accept that the Knicks are going to go at him, probably gets scores on him more easily but that also keeps the other players from getting fouls and allows to increase pace (this is the little secret no one talks about) so playing at home and quickly getting the ball out of the basket and pushing it right back and increasing the pace which gets the crowd hype and tires out a thin Knicks roster could be a very good strategy.  THEN you have another confident wing out there who can score for you and it just opens it up more for Haliburton and Myles Turner because a confident high octane Mathurin, is actually a REAL threat.\n\nThat being said, I think Mathurin is a bad fit for the Pacers. He could easily score 25ppg for a non-playoff team. He is losing a lot of money by being on the bench like this. That in itself is a huge sacrifice for a player who is often wrongly perceived as a \"selfish\" player.\n\nWhile I think Math doesn't fit with the Pacers and not is a prototype player for Carlisle. I do actually think that Rick has a soft spot for Mathurin. You can tell by the way he talks about him... Rick knows and gets all this and picks and chooses when the thinking player doesn't work anymore.. and you just need the instinctive, gutsy, edgy player to run through the wall for you.\n\nI hope this is tonight. Warning. It will be 2 steps forward one step back. But that would still be Net one step forward going to the NBA finals. Hope the crowd shows him love.\n\nThoughts?",

Like you said, he’s a confidence guy, and I think the start to the series, especially game 2 where he was essentially pulled from the rotation, are making him overthink everything. In the playoffs your reaction times have to be quicker, and right now he’s waiting too long and is unsure of what to do. \n\nYou combine his offensive problems with the fact he’s simply not a good defender yet and it’s hard to justify putting him out there ahead of Sheppard who actually is doing a decent job defending and knows his role (space the floor, shoot some 3’s better). I love the kid but when he’s not barreling to the rim and getting FT’s he gets exploited in games. I think he could be moved in the summer but we’ll have to see how the rest of this offseason pans out",

    "selftext": "[Source](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/live-blogs/nba-free-agency-2025-offseason-trade-rumors-news/fnwUjcuMFEqi/ruoFTT0nB1HR/)\n\n>Saturday afternoon, in a move first reported by *The Athletic*, the Philadelphia 76ers tendered Quentin Grimes an $8.7 million qualifying offer, making him a restricted free agent. That will allow Philadelphia to match any offer Grimes gets on the open free-agent market.\n\n>The Sixers have been in contact with Grimes and his camp, although the price may end up being steep. Grimes, 25, is looking for a contract that averages $25 million per season, league sources tell The Athletic. He has emerged as a dynamic scoring guard, and he gives the Sixers a mix of the ability to shoot from the perimeter and get to the basket and put pressure on the rim off the dribble.\n\n>Grimes is important to the Sixers because they need to retain all the talent they can — and he has emerged as a talent. Between Grimes, Tyrese Maxey, Jared McCain and the newly drafted VJ Edgecombe, the strength of Philadelphia’s roster resides in its backcourt. Grimes is versatile enough to move to the small forward spot, which would allow head coach Nick Nurse to employ three-guard lineups. He’s someone who also defends well enough to make an impact at the point of attack.\n\n>But while the 76ers can retain Grimes, they may not be able to re-sign unresticted free agent Guerschon Yabusele, which would be a big blow.",

    "title": "What's the next team exploit or solution? E.g., GSW screens, OKC ballhounding",
    "selftext": "The GSW dynasty maximized the power of its shooters Curry and Thompson by constantly setting really physical screens that were arguably fouls by the letter of the law but infrequently called in the NBA. Sort of high-volume pseudo-fouling. This was one of the key force multipliers for GSW that helped create a dominant dynasty with several historically great seasons.\n\nEventually, GSW's style of play was somewhat mitigated by teams mauling Curry off-ball and the loss of Bogut. By basically high-volume pseudo-fouling Curry off ball, opponents mitigated the force-multiplying effects of GSW's high-volume, pseudo-fouling screening offense.\n\nRight now, some NBA fans are angry at OKC because they play an extremely aggressive and physical brand of defense but do not pick up a lot of foul calls. As with the Warriors, this is a matter of maximizing their roster's talents as adapted to reffing practices. Dort and Caruso are both excellent defenders who are very willing to play at the margins of the rules. They are smaller players (Dort not really, but he gets treated like one by the refs), and refs have historically allowed smaller players to get away with more contact on defense, especially against bigs. The rest of their perimeter defenders are also very skilled and scrappy. We saw Cason Wallace blatantly fouling McConnell in front of a ref without getting a foul call and then forcing a steal. SGA and JDub play cleaner defense since OKC needs their offensive output but they're still very skilled and engaged defenders. Having Dort and Caruso and other role players being super aggressive and physical on defense gets in opposing players heads when fouls aren't called, and it leads to more mistakes, and more turnovers, a positive reinforcement cycle that lets OKC get into its great transition offense. A force multiplier like GSW's screening. \n\nSo, my question is, what is the solution to OKC's defensive gameplan, and/or what is the next exploit for a team to capitalize on? What is the anti-OKC equivalent of mauling Curry off ball? What is the next GSW/OKC-style force multiplier for a team maximizing its talents as adapted to the league's reffing? I think it needs to either be a defensive thing or an off-ball offense thing. On-ball offense has a lot of exploits (e.g., flopping and pushoffs), but they're moreso individual enhancers, less so full-team force multipliers. \n\nOne idea is offensive players grabbing defensive players off-ball. Defenders are allowed to do this and do it very aggressively especially after the three-point revolution. We saw for example how physical Houston got against GSW this postseason. With OKC's aggressively ballhounding defense, could off-ball offensive players simply grab off-ball OKC defenders to slow down the traps and closeouts? It's like a screen without a screener. I know offensive players already do this to some extent, but I'm imagining a team-wide philosophy built around it the way GSW built its screening style or OKC's ballhounding style. I'm sure there is some level of frequent off-ball contact by offensive players that refs will be inclined to let slide for the sake of game flow. It could be a matter of finding that line and walking it and expanding it. That's just one idea I'm throwing out there.",

When you think of a defensive lineman going inside in football, it can be hard to tell what’s a hold vs what’s a legal block. But if the play is to the outside, the hold becomes obvious when the offensive lineman is grabbing and restricting movement.\n\nIt’s not perfectly analogous, but most of the time in basketball the offensive player has to cut through the defensive player to create action, and some degree of contact is expected. Conversely, if the offensive player is holding the defensive player from the corner trying to collapse the paint (simple example), that becomes extremely obvious.",

        "body": "> So, my question is, what is the solution to OKC's defensive gameplan, and/or what is the next exploit for a team to capitalize on? \n\nIllegal screens? If aggressive, physical defense is the cause of the TOs, then physical/illegal screens to create separation from defenders should somewhat neutralize that advantage. Ideally, more separation should result in better decision making and fewer TOs.  Using the Warriors as an example of a team that uses illegal screens. GSW won the regular season series 2-1. The Warriors did turn the ball over, they've never been a low TO team. They limited live ball TOs, which sparks OKC's transition offense. Caruso only played in the first game against GSW, which was an OKC loss, and Chet didn't play against them at all, so this is a flawed example, but it's the best I can think of right now. \n\nIf we're looking at player archetypes, then Haliburton is unironically a counter to OKC's defense. A high-volume playmaker that rarely turns the ball over. As we saw in the finals, there were large stretches when OKC's defense couldn't force TOs. \n\nStyle-wise wise a team that doesn't pass the ball much like the Celtics. More passing, more opportunities for passing lane steals. OKC, the Celtics, and the Cavs are the 3 teams at the bottom in TO%. All 3 teams are also at the bottom in passes per game.",

It’s more of a roster construction thing than coaching strategy thing.\n\nWith that said I think the next thing is might be the balance tilting more toward depth and away from star power. Playoffs always used to be where stars shine the brightest, and Pat Riley famously once said in playoffs you play 8 and trust 7. But off the top of my head this is the first playoffs I can remember when the deeper teams (OKC and Indy) consistently overwhelmed teams with comparable top-end talent on paper (Denver, Minnesota, NY comes to mind). Having depth, and the coach’s willingness to use it, contributed a ton to both of the conference champs’ runs.\n\nOr it could be as simple (and difficult) as just playing hard. Having depth and a coach that pushes the right buttons, helps; but if playing your ass off is easy everyone would be doing it.",

Maybe if the guy setting the screen falls down on purpose in a direction that continues to screen for the ball handler, they might be able to get away with that pretty regularly.

The only way to do that is cutting down the things that slow the game down or advertisements and we know they aren't cutting down ads. So what do they do? Call less fouls. 2 of the biggest complaints in general is players flopping and that the refs need to \"let the players play the game and decide the outcome stop trying to have it be the ref show\". If they stop calling as many fouls that partly fixes both problems while allowing them to shorten the game like they want to do.\n\n\nThe next step is going to be having bigger and stronger players who can dominate physically. I know these guys are truly rare but what would a MJ, LeBron or Shaq look like in the league today in their prime with 4 shooters who can play defense. Somebody like Zion Williamson if he stayed healthy would have been amazing against OKC with a proper team built around him. Look at what Luka did to OKC a year ago, he was a strong great ball handler who could make all the passes and shoot from 30 feet. Look at Jokic this year with 2 injured starters and a weak bench and he gave OKC a real tough series. Look at Giannis. Look at how Embiid played when healthy.\n\n\nThat didn't answer your question exactly but it is either that or do what Boston was doing. Play good defense, be tall, have 3 or 4 capable ball handlers and shoot a lot of 3s at a good percentage.\n\n\nHonestly a new style or strategy of basketball is only going to happen when they tweak the rules and the next generational players step in and change the game.

Heck even the \"next guy\" Wemby still needs a better team and to either get stronger and become a playmaker or start shooting at KD levels to make a truly League defining change.",

    "selftext": "I want to share three things that I observed during Game 3, on which I'd like the input of the community.  Agree, disagree, have a different take?  Let's discuss! I'll start by stating that I am a youth basketball coach.  With that out of the way, onto the relevant items...\n\n(1) The \"they can't blow the whistle every possession\" defensive strategy was in full effect by both teams.  We saw right from the start that the refs seemed to be aware of this narrative with a couple of quick whistles, but they largely let both teams play a very physical brand of basketball, particularly off ball.  This brings me to the main tactic of this strategy which caught my attention...\n\n(2) Right from the start, the Pacers were impeding/hanging onto/holding SGA off-ball and just generally doing everything they could to wear him down.  This tactic is frequently seen in youth basketball being employed against the other team's best player near season's end in leagues where teams are very familiar with one another.  This was recently re-popularized in the NBA when the Lakers did it to Jokic in the regular season.  The Thunder used this strategy to great effect against the Nuggets \\[edited to correct typo\\] to win their playoff series this year.  The Thunder also use it against Haliburton.  Game 3 was Indiana fully committing to this tactic to slow down SGA.  It wasn't a panacea as the Thunder had some wide open threes as a result, but it did contribute to the turnovers for the Thunder.\n\n(3) The Pacers seemed to be changing how they were defending different actions at different points to confuse the Thunder.  This is always a great idea, IF you can pull it off without blowing up your own defense because your players mess up.\n\nI'm excited to see what comes next in Game 4, and even more excited for this discussion!",

        "body": "It seems like a big part of the Pacers strategy throughout the whole playoffs is to just wear down the other team by running as many actions as possible (in like 8-12 seconds) when they're forced into the half court, and then pushing for transition at every opportunity (even if it's to ultimately end up in a half court offense). It's a major reason they keep having these outlier comebacks. They wear down the other team and can put up a lot of points if the other team ever takes their \"foot off the gas\" so-to-speak. \n\nNow, they've started pressing more (and earlier). They're denying SGA possession and forcing someone else to create/initiate offense. If they need SGA to get the ball he has to use more energy to do so. You could tell SGA was gassed when he contested Haliburton, who then missed - only for Haliburton to get his own rebound because SGA was just walking around after the shot instead of boxing out or crashing the rim. \n\nWilliams had a good night but the Thunder didn't seem to be in any sort of rhythm without SGA initiating things at the end of the game. Their offense fizzled out as he got tired and nobody else could create or guarantee a basket at the end of a close game. \n\nThis was kind of my issue with the Thunder going into this series. They struggle in the half court when SGA isn't initiating things for them. \n\nSometimes it doesn't matter because a few of their players can get hot from the three and they'll just blow teams out. \n\nBut they'll have issues when games are close and nobody else is shooting particularly well. If SGA can't consistently score around his averages for one reason (poor shooting) or another (defense denying him the ball) down the stretch and the game is close, then the Thunder don't always seem to know what to do. It happened near the end of games 1 and 3. \n\nWilliams also hasn't been shooting great for a lot of the playoffs, particularly from 3. He started getting better against Minnesota, but then he went back down to ~30% in the finals. \n\nHe's 3/11 right now in the whole series. And he was 2/9 before last night. I think the Pacers realized they could let him \"get his\" to just stop SGA from initiating things while gassing him. \n\nThey might need to see if Caruso can initiate things, but then he has to stay out of foul trouble and shoot well if he's going to do that for longer stretches. And teams will still live with him shooting 2-3 threes a game even if he makes them. Caruso played alright in G3 and it didn't seem to matter. \n\nThe strategy could have been different but I'm not sure if it would have changed enough at the end of that game. \n\nChet didn't shoot well (0/6 from three). But him and Dort were the only players that even technically won their minutes (albeit by only being +1 in the game as a whole). \n\nChet, Williams and SGA still all had 20+ pts, though. \n\nThey lost a lot of Williams minutes, however (he was -9) and Caruso actually had the worst stretches (-15), which is unusual. \n\nBut, again, I think Indiana opting for the \"anyone but Shai\" strategy pretty much lets whoever have a decent game until a point, and then bets that everyone else won't be able to execute consistently during the final minutes of a close game.",

Add in that Indy plays very fast and fully uses its bench (which allows Hai to rest) and its no wonder they tire out the Thunder down the stretch of games. You can see it even took a toll on JDub and Chet. They did it to the Bucks, Cavs and Knicks.\n\nTo Point 3, you can tell that the Pacers watched alot of film on the Thunder before gm 3. There was a play where Hali intercepted a wraparound pass SGA threw to Chet off a P&R, and you know it was a designed read because SGA didn’t even look at Chet he jus knew he was gonna be there…TJ intercepted a cross court pass from SGA in a similar fashion. Gotta give credit to rick carlisle’s coachin this playoff run, its been fun to watch him make these adjustments.\n\nSGA will get his but if he doesn’t have legs down the stretch, thats a win for the Thunder. Its jus so crazy to me how the Thunder look like they’re dominating Indy but Indy, like they against every other opponent, just continues to find a way to stick around…even if Hali isn’t killin",

        "body": "1) I don't think either team is playing overly physical. They are playing within the bounds of what they think the refs will allow in a Finals game. I think the reffing in game 3 was good and is typical of what you expect in the Finals. They always \"let them play\" in the Finals. It creates a more exciting game. (Maybe it's not healthy for the refs to let them do that all 82 games of the regular season. And it reduces scoring. But it's definitely good for the Finals.)\n\n2) I think this is pretty standard in playoff basketball. Just ask any Steph Curry fan. It's something that's easy to miss unless you're watching for it. But if you do watch for it, I think you see it on almost every play. It's often not the star players getting held. It's just a way that defenders conserve energy and make the offensive player work.\n\n3) I haven't noticed this much in Game 3 but I'm not great at watching for it when I'm caught up in the game. I didn't notice them going zone any. I mainly notice that they put Nemhard on Shai as much as possible, and the Thunder didn't seem very good at creating mismatches to be targeted.  \n\nWhat impressed me the most is how deep and balanced the Pacers are. It makes it harder for the Thunder to know which player to attack on defense. There isn't an obvious target. Haliburton is not a bad defender, and if you spend a lot of energy and time attacking him, it doesn't really hurt the Pacers that much because he's not really a volume scorer and there's plenty of other scorers to pick up the slack.",

    "selftext": "Watching these playoffs have been a unique experience as we near the end of the final four. The teams left are not ones that have significant stars that dominate as much as we have seen historically. The era of the big 3 seemed brief as we now have many teams making it deep into the playoffs that may have more chemistry than star power. Boston had a well rounded team last year that all seemed to focus on their roles to succeed.\n\nI am a Timberwolves fan and what I really have noticed is how much the full Thunder roster puts in effort on almost every play. Whether offense or defense and no matter if they start or not. SGA gets criticism for foul baiting but you can't blame him if the refs give him the call. The whole team seems to be doing whatever it takes to win (and may be getting the benefit of the doubt). You could say that the Twolves have significant star power and maybe more personality but they have moments where players quit on plays or just don't seem to give 100%.\n\nThe Pacers also seem to have a similar identity with players normally not considered stars putting in a ton of effort to get the win. Running on every possession.\n\nThe more I think about it the more I think this is the best thing that could happen for the NBA. We have had the instances where a star gets the whistle, but now instead we have the effort getting the whistle. It opens up the idea of \"who wants it more?\" and in some cases I really think the wolves do not (cough* Julius Randle not running back on defence *cough).\n\nDoes anyone have any thoughts on this? I know I mentioned two teams that are currently ahead in their series, which may be influencing my narrative. But does anyone disagree?",

Not as much as some people think, but it helps. \n\nI haven’t seen a series this year where a genuinely inferior team won because of effort. A single game? Sure. But not a whole series. Winning consistently is about exploiting matchups and executing your game plan. ",

The teams in the final 4 are all stacked in terms of talent, and in terms of Indiana who might not have as much ‘star power’ as the Knicks, all of their role guys are amazing role players, that are empowered by the best remaining coach left in the playoffs and the best passer remaining. The thunder are just a defensive juggernaut similar to the Celtics in 2022, but honestly a bit deeper. They have a bunch of elite defenders who cover multiple positions, so matching up into them with out an elite pg will be near impossible, part of the reason the t-wolves are struggling so much, none of their offence comes easy. \n\nCarlisle and Spo were the only two coaches that out coached Joe Mazz last playoffs, but the Celtics were just waaay too talented even without zinger to beat. This year they were just exhausted and riddled with injuries. \n\nThere’s defo been a swing starting with the Denver chip, that went away from the big 3 model in favour of 1 or 2 stars with elite role players surrounding them, but they need an amazing playmaker as the star to really make this work. Tatum stepped up for Boston last year, and obviously Jokic was that guy for Denver.",

        "body": "This is similar to what's happened with gegenpressing and a little bit of Pep Guardiola's influence in the English Premier League. Playing intense, highly structured defense became a tactic used by the top-tier teams in the EPL like Manchester City, Liverpool, and Tottenham (under Pochettino). And the less talented teams that did it well (like Leeds United) would also outperform expectations compared to those that didn't. It has become table stakes for the best teams in the world. It's now a necessary, but not sufficient, way to play. It's increased injuries and has started pushing some of the world's best athletes to their limits.\n\nAs a Pacers fan, I'm watching something similar, where the pace of play will have the same impact on the league as the increased usage of 3-point shots. Teams that can play with deep rotations and consistently play with the velocity of the Pacers and Thunder will outperform teams that don't. Then, it will become table stakes for everyone.\n\nIf this turns out to be the path of the future, having to build 10 deep rotations will really fuck with the heads of GMs throughout the league.",

With a few exceptions, the NBA since the 80s has been dominated by 3 or 4 superstars per generation who separate themselves from the rest of the pack and dominate the league.  Whatever teams said superstars are on are usually prevailing favorites to at least be in the conference finals every year. I think those days might be over. Of course there will still be an MVP each season, but the league is so deep with skill players that the separation between tiers of players is very shallow. I think this will create a league that looks more like the NFL in terms of parity and \"teams\" being the focal point rather than individual superstars",

Most casual fans didn't even know who Jalen Williams was until he made the All Star game, and thought Chet was Shai's only running mate due to him having lots of hype leading up to him being selected 2nd overall in his draft. J-Dub was actually one of the only 4 guards in NBA history who averaged 14 ppg in his rookie season on 50% FG, the others being MJ, Magic... and Ben Simmons. He also did it while shooting the most 3s out of them, a real bucket getter from the start. Unfortunately, being a 12th pick on a small market team that was losing games doesn't get you a lot of attention.\n \nAs for the Pacers, the only known guys are Hali, a rising star who was recently an Olympian, Siakam, the second best player on a championship team, and Myles Turner, whose name has been on trade rumors for the last 5 years.\n \nHell, I thought Aaron Nesmith was just your run of the mill 3 and D guy until I looked up his stats and found out he was shooting 50/40/90 for the season, only missing the club due to his missed games. Nembhard and Mathurin are the other young guys from this Pacers core, and nothing from Nembhard's skillset seems to stand out that much (though it is very complete for a role player), so it's hard to market him as some kind of co-star next to Hali, and Mathurin is a microwave scorer on a team that isn't built around that kind of play, which tanks his numbers and makes him look worse than he actually is.\n \nEdit: I'm also gonna add that the \"Big 3\" model only looked good because of the anomalies that were prime LeBron and those absolutely broken KD Warriors teams. The Celtics Big 3 only won 1 title, so you might as well treat them like any other non-big3 team that won the championship.",

They built the team to beat the wrong juggernaut. Denver has the best player, but OKC built the best car. What you saw was a team that knew it was beaten from Game 1 because the OKC defense might be the best we’ve ever seen given that it’s never been harder to defend. They attacked the dribble with double teams and dared Minnesota’s role players to beat them. The Pacers play fast and tire out a team lacking depth and defense. Both teams have superstars, both teams are well-coached, and both teams play a style of basketball that’s fun to watch.

    "title": "Why SGA is so disliked: An in-depth analysis",
    "selftext": "With SGA winning MVP, I've seen a massive number of people say that he's \"the worst MVP in decades,\" (despite the numbers saying him, LeBron, and Steph are neck and neck for the best MVP season this century) and it seems like anytime his skill is acknowledged, the entirety of social media comes out of the woodworks to make an unoriginal joke about him shooting free throws.\n\nI can't remember the last time I've seen a player receive this much hate, and to be honest I'm not at all surprised. The SGA hate comes from a perfect storm of circumstances. Here is why:\n\n**1)** First, the surface level reason that everyone immediately points to: he shoots a lot of free throws. Not only does he shoot a lot of free throws, but he also seeks contact and exaggerates it. In conjunction with OKC's physical defense, it is completely understandable how this is frustrating.\n\nThis frustration is increased when people are faced with the fact that essentially every statistic shows that Shai is no anomaly when it comes to shooting free throws (\\*Of the last 15 MVPS, Shai is 12th in free throw attempts per game; he shoots the exact same number of free throws as Luka did last season, and shoots less than players like Kobe, Jordan, AI, LeBron, KD, Malone, etc., his foul rate is incredibly low for having the top 4 highest driving seasons in NBA history, and so on\\*).\n\n  \n**2)** While players drawing fouls is nothing new, and we've seen stars do it for years and get rewarded for it, what makes SGA different isn't the \\*way\\* in which he draws fouls, as many like to argue, but instead it's that his playstyle doesn't offset the free throws in many people's minds. See, players like Luka, who bait for fouls just as much as SGA does, don't get the hate because while Shai is quietly shooting layups and pull-ups from the mid-range, Luka is hitting step-backs from 40 feet deep, making circus shots, and getting techs while talking shit to opposing players and yelling at the refs.\n\nObviously, Luka being an established and heavily marketed star since his rookie year helps, since his status has been ingrained in people's minds and he doesn't need to earn their respect anymore, but his more traditionally \"exciting\" playstyle and his strong emotions lead to more highlight plays, so people are less likely to criticize him. \n\n  \n**3)** OKC, along with Shai, came out of nowhere in the eyes of casual fans. The NBA decided to completely ignore marketing SGA and the Thunder up until now, when they realized that they're sort of forced to at this point, so a ton of people have barely watched any Thunder games the past few years. I mean, even after being the youngest team to ever win a playoff series last season and being the number one seed with the MVP runner-up, OKC still wasn't even in the top 15 for National TV games, they didn't get a Christmas game, and most people couldn't even differentiate between \\*Jalen\\* Williams and \\*Jaylin\\* Williams.\n\nWhen the NBA realized their mistake after OKC started dominating and Shai looked like the MVP, they suddenly had to make up for the lack of marketing they'd done, so then they had to HEAVILY market Shai and the Thunder for the past few months. To many people, it felt like Shai and the Thunder just came out of nowhere and the NBA was forcing them down their throats.\n\nThis is the most critical factor. People don't like to be wrong and have their beliefs challenged, so when they hear someone comparing some player they've never heard of to NBA legends, they immediately feel jaded, as in their mind \"if this guy was so good, I would've seen him all over SportsCenter. Surely he isn't as good as you say.\" \n\nSo, when they see people start talking about his free throws, they immediately find a reason to justify their original belief. \"I knew there had to be a catch, so THAT'S why I didn't hear much about him, he isn't actually as good as they said, he just gets a lot of foul calls. That makes sense. They’re trying to create a new star.”\n\n**4)** OKC's dominance will obviously lead to bitterness from fans of opposing teams. When your team gets dominated, resentment will build. We saw this exact thing with the New England Patriots in the NFL. OKC is forcing turnovers at a historic rate, which also leads to them having a historic number of 10-0 and 15-0 runs (more than triple any other team), which is an incredibly disheartening way to lose games, so people want to find reasons for their team losing so badly. Again, due to OKC being overlooked and underrated by so many people, casual fans especially often doubt them and believe that their team can win, so when their team is blown out, they need to find some sort of motivated reasoning to confirm their opinion.\n\n  \n**5)** An amalgamation of other things, like OKC's postgame interviews, Shai being a foreign-born player (but not European, so European fans won't support him--the same way Embiid didn't have the inherent support of American or European fans, being from Cameroon), OKC's youth, OKC's brief stretch of tanking which upset a lot of people, OKC being a small market team who doesn't have a large market to get mainstream recognition or fandom that still gets hate from fans of the Sonics who feel their team was stolen, the fact his competition was Jokic, who is beloved and had a historically great season, his love of fashion and lack of traditional ultra-masculinity, so you see people who like ultra-masculinity throwing homophobic nicknames at him (remember the SKIMS ads?).\n\n  \nUltimately, it makes complete sense why Shai is hated. On the surface, it would seem baffling that people hate a young, humble, respectful player in a small market who has avoided any controversy, has beaten the odds as a someone who was never expected to make the NBA in college, and then was never expected to be a star in his early career, and has exceeded all expectations.\n\nBut when you take into account all the factors mentioned here, it could not be clearer. I hope you don't just ignore this little write-up and continue to mindlessly hate. It's the nature of fandom, humans, and the cycle of the league, and the hate will eventually die down, but it is absolutely at an all-time high right now.",

I love his fluid drives to the rim. But it just feels like he does that less and less, and does more and more of the \"intentionally bounce off his defender into a shot\" or other \"try to get fouled\" actions that are just not enjoyable to watch. For me, other high-profile players that are accused of that (Harden, Jimmy, Brunson, Luka) are still enjoyable to watch most of the time, so they get more of a pass.\n\nI wrote this in another comment the other day, and it seems laughably obvious and somehow sad that it needs to be said at all:\n\n\\> I like watching shots, dribbles, passes, rebounds, fakes, blocks, steals, screens, cuts, close-outs, rotations, switches, footwork, balance, agility. Basically, legal individual basketball skills and legal team offensive and defensive tactics.\n\n\\> I don't like watching holds, elbows, hooks, shoves, trips, punches, kicks, flops. Basically, illegal or non-basketball actions.\n\nI'd include \"try to get fouled\" actions as non-basketball actions. Some people seem to include them as a part of the game, and I guess it's okay if they like to watch that. But for me, a player's or team's ratio of basketball to non-basketball actions is a large part of what makes them enjoyable to watch. Watching someone be really successful with a high non-basketball ratio elevates it from just unenjoyable to hateworthy.",

I mean the Pacers are looking at Brunson who will almost certainly shoot a dozen FT every night so SGA is far from unique even in the playoffs right now.  I don't understand the obsession with his FT.  They aren't remotely an anomaly for a player that scores at that volume and goes to the rim so much.  Pretty much every star player in the NBA does acting on contact with the exception of those guys who are slight and deliberately try and avoid contact (like Steph, Haliburton).  If SGA was as bad as people say, he should be shooting at least 10 FT a game, and more in the playoffs.\n\nI will say over the last decade or so we've seen some teams masterfully play the system by making in retrospect incredibly lopsided trades, taking advantage of impatient owners, and then drafting and developing well, like OkC and Boston, and it can certainly generate a lot of resentment in other fan bases who are frankly, jealous, that their franchise isn't run as well.  I guess SGA is just the face they can put to that.",

I don’t mind Shai using his pace control to generate an advantage, and he’s going to get fouled sometimes and that’s fine to call. But his grifting reduces the quality of the basketball being played. And that reduces the popularity and value of the game.\n\nI’m not saying I have an answer, fouls are part of the game, and I even think that maybe the NBA is giving defenses too much leeway in some cases, though the balance seems decent right now. And it’s hard enough for the refs to focus on the calling actual fouls, on and off ball, to expect them to be able to judge unnatural or non-basketball movements to generate foul calls. The best idea I have right now is to have some sort of post game review of each player with some sort of consequence for grifting. Maybe a system like they have with technical and flagrant fouls, where you have some number of credit before a players gets fined or suspended. The other issue is that even with replay, it can be hard to judge some instances, so erring on the side of the most obvious would be okay. I think the same thing can be applied to off ball behavior, be it offensive or defensive, where there is clear fouling that doesn’t get called because the refs are focused on the ball (which, ironically, leads to more flopping to try to get the call off ball). I don’t like any sort of real time, in game reviews of these since that makes the games even harder to watch, but they have to find some way to incentivize players to stop foul grifting.\n\nI’m a GSW fan, and I get frustrated both by inconsistency of the non-calls on Steph while Shai just existing gets called a few times per game, and I’m also frustrated watching Jimmy Buckets make a completely unnatural move going for a foul call instead of just focusing on making the bucket.

The reason why he gets hate is because he’s being focused on so every aspect of his game will get broken down.

    "selftext": "Jalen Williams against the nuggets has posted 3 games under 35% true shooting, and is shooting just 20% from deep on the series. In addition, he has also posted 4 games shooting horrendously on 2s(3-11, 2-8, 3-9, and 3-12 last game). Watching the games, Denver is either leaving Jdub wide open or is hitting him with single coverage, and often times SGA is supplying him with fantastic looks in his spots. Even in transition Jdub has been subpar, with an infamous bricked wide open dunk yesterday. Throughout this series, it seems that whenever the ball finds its way into Jdub's hands things are most likely going to go poorly for OKC, especially if this happens down the stretch in a tight game\n\nSo why exactly has his offensive production taken such a nosedive compared to what it was like in the regular season? Is it just nerves or is there something else at play that could explain why Jdub is struggling to offensively produce from anywhere on the court in this series? And assuming that OKC somehow advances, do these persistent struggles significantly reduce their ceiling well below expectation?",

He was also the best player in our R1 series, while SGA was below his standards. \n\n\nBut we need to have a but of perspective here: he is a third year player get the absolute star treatment in the same way Jamal Murray has. He is being schemed with a bad match up for him, Jamal has had two good games and JDub has has one G3. \n\n\nThe scheme Denver is running takes away all of jDubs strengths and his real issue is how poor he has shot the three ball. So it has compounded, where he is being sagged off more. \n\n\nI have been frustrated with his performances in this series as an OKC fan no doubt. \n\n\nBut all OKC fans knew it wasn't guaranteed he'd suddenly average 25ppg on good efficiency in the Playoffs. No one was calling him an elite scorer, he was recognized for being a very good all around player on a 68 win team, albeit with SGA going crazy and an all time defense. \n\n\nIn G7 and beyond his offensive growth comes from being a significantly better rim finisher in traffic and taking and making easier jump shots. Not living off contest midrange and open rim finishes. That shot diet has cratered his efficiency because people make those shots even harder. ",

    "selftext": "Not to overreact to this game and definitely not a hate post towards him, since I’ve been watching SGA and the Thunder for a good few years now and I know how skilled and talented he is. Obviously about to win MVP, and he had a great Game 2 and was great in last year’s series against Dallas. \n\nBut watching this game and his struggles brought me back to some earlier thoughts I had last playoffs watching him in the first round series last year against the Pelicans -  notably Herb Jones. I noticed that Shai had to exert so much effort to get by Herb, many counters, fakes, stop-and-go’s, leading to difficult highly contested shots, tough fade-aways, leaners, etc. Mainly, because it felt like he was getting almost redirected off his driving path by the defender hand-checking, and we know that higher amounts of contact is allowed in the postseason. I saw a similar situation today vs an obviously worse defender in Braun, but it still seemed to affect and even tire him out by the 4th and OT period, as he started settling for bad 3 pointers and deferring to his teammates. \n\nJust seems like he had a little more weight on his slender frame, similar to let’s say Ant, he would be a more effective driver and creator in the playoffs. Definitely not enough to affect his shiftiness and quickness, which are clearly integral to his scoring game. Just 5-10 pounds of weight and muscle to help with fighting through bumps and steering by the defender as he drives, and it would probably help him finish at an even higher clip at the rim, even though he’s already one of the most efficient finishers in the league as a guard. What y’all think?",

He averaged 18 points and 11 rebounds per game in the 1982-1983 season and yet there are only a few dozen of images of him and he is never mentioned. He seems to have been completely overshadowed by the headband wearing cliff Robinson of the 90s, but even then I wouldn't expect him to be as forgotten as he is. Is there any other reason for why he is never mentioned in any conversations?",

Draymond's lack of midrange scoring and finishing and poor shooting has made the warriors hopeless without Steph., especially vs zone defense. \n.\n\nJosh Hart is only good because the Knicks lineup has 4 floor spacers who are elite shot creators and finishers OR great catch and shoot 3 guys( bridges, Brunson, Kat, and OG)",

    "title": "The Top 10 All-time skills/abilities in NBA history",
    "selftext": "When you watch the game, there comes times when you watch players do things that drop your jaw and get you off your seat and you end up thinking: Is this player the best I have ever seen? Well, you might not be wrong since in that very moment they well might be. This is my list of the top 10 all time skills/abilities. \n\n\n\n**1. Steph’s 3 point shooting**\n\nI don’t think there’s any other player that has revolutionised the game as much as he did. Enough said.\n\n**2.Shaq’s dominance at the rim**\n\nToo dominant at the rim. Felt like a man playing children in his prime. I can still feel the hopelessness of those who tried to defend him\n\n**3. KD’s mid-range scoring**\n\nAbsolute sniper. This skill felt so much felt like a cheat code when you were watching it.\n\n**4. LeBron/MJ’s freakish athleticism**\n\nBefore their fans come at me, I think both were very athletic. Lebron is like the perfect specimen made to play basketball. \n\nFlight Mike on the hand might not be as big, but his vertical leaps, his agility and lighting-quick release and the way his hands could palm the ball make him just as good\n\n**5. Bill Russel’s Defense**\n\nThere have been many great defenders in the game but I don’t think many are as effective. His BBIQ and the way he rebounded and altered the other team’s shots make him an all time great. A true defensive savant and leader. \n\n**6. Jokic/Nash’s offensive systems(BBIQ)**\n\nMost teams build an offensive system around the best player’s abilities but these two were the system. Watching both at their prime was/is a marvel. \n\nI think Jokic has the highest BBIQ in history. He is able to make plays that I myself cant see while watching the whole field. I’m pretty sure he gives his coaches imposter syndrome. What really could you could advise him when he sees things you can’t\n\n**7. Magic/Stockton’s passing**\n\nElite at ball distribution. In an alternate world where Stockton was drafted to the Lakers that young he would be just as great.\n\n**8. Swiss-army knives(Luka/Kawhi)**\n\nSometimes when watching Luka I feel like he’s the most talented player in NBA history. Now before the pitch forks come out about his defense, Offensively there is nothing he can’t do. He’s elite at all three levels of scoring with great passing, high BBIQ, physically imposing with good handles and a bag that can put defenders on skates. I couldn’t tell you what his best skill is. I think he will be the all-time NBA ‘prince’. I don’t he has it in him to be the king. Some of his best plays are truly ‘magical’\n\nKawhi Leonard. A Coaches dream. Something about his versatility makes me feel like he can walk into any line up past or present. There is nothing he can’t do well. Nothing you can exploit. A tool made to win titles\n\n**9. Kyrie’s handles**\n\nA Hooper’s dream. If someone called him the greatest hooper ever, I wouldn’t mind because I know exactly what you mean\n\n**10. Wilt/Wemby’s length**\n\nWilt absolutely abused his length against his opponents. Almost felt unfair\n\nWemby’s career is still loading but if all goes well he could be doing to current nba players what Wilt was doing to the players back them\n\nP.S: There’s alot of honourable mentions I considered. I couldn’t name them all",

People forget that he was an All-Star starter in 2020 and crucial piece to Boston’s team in 2020 and 2021, but seemingly once he arrived in New York, he was never the same. \n\nEventually only played barely two seasons further in the NBA and retired from basketball at the age of 34. Yes he was undersized and had issues on defense, but this guy was really one of the most dynamic point guards at one point in the league. I really don’t understand what happened that he suddenly deteriorated. ",

This to me is the main advantage of the European system, that elite players can be professionals younger and get promoted up to their level of competency rather than spending however many years being 'the man' against players their own age and not learning how to fit in on a team.\n\nAlso the team with the best defense in modern NBA history and relatively weak shooters just won the championship.",

And who knows who else is on the chopping block. Keep in mind there are few ways to improve the team.\n\nOne line comes to mind - he doesn't want to play in a small market outside of Milwaukee. I don't think Houston, San Antonio, Toronto peak his interest. A challenging road still with no off court upside. He would rather wait another year.\n\nNext offseason he will have full control like AD did when leaving New Orleans. The noise around LA and NY seems the most convincing. To me, pairing up with Luka seems the most in line with his nature. Similar minded European, perfect PnR teammate. Or maybe he goes to NY with someone I can't think of yet. Regardless, this whole process makes no sense.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

    "selftext": "For me:\n\n“Paolo can never be a number one option due to his efficiency” This take is definitely not factoring in the current construction of the Magic team, where he has no real threats from outside besides KCP(shot well below his averages this year) and sometimes Wagner. Currently him and Franz are playing on hard mode offensively, taking a lot of midrange jumpers because the lane is clogged. Paolo has great shot making for his age and very good vision as a passer, dismissing him as a Carmelo regen is wild to me\n\n“Trae Young is the worst defender in the league” Think most people have realized this to be untrue, but Garland has definitely taken his throne at this point. Trae puts genuine effort on defense especially as a help defender. He’s 6’0 so he’s still buns but he’s not the worst anymore imo\n\n“Giannis can’t play off ball” is a funny take, because he was primarily off-ball during the championship run, ran a lot of pick and roll with Middleton and Jrue, and was being thrown much more lobs. Teams don’t help off him on offense because he crashes the glass and cuts often. The real culprit for this is because of the lack of Middleton because of injury, and the lack of a third ball handler outside of Dame and Giannis. Dame is too old to handle the ball every possession while he’s playing the best defense in his career.\n\n“Dame is the reason why the Bucks are a bad defense” Obviously losing Jrue was bad, but poor roster construction and sitting certain players on the bench was a huge reason why Bucks were a bottom 10 defense last season. Bucks this season were a top 15 defense even with Dame starting and Lopez regressing. Part of it is Giannis obviously but Lillard has been putting more effort this season on that end compared to any of his previous seasons with the Blazers\n\nTell me yours everyone!!!\n",

This is untrue since both statistically & eye test wise his best seasons was from 2018-2020 (the post Butler/pre Edwards era), however he wasn't relevant since the Wolves teams he was on was giga terrible so no one outside of diehard Wolves fans watched him.  \n\nAlso for Edwards, while it's generally acknowledged that he's a good shooter, I still think a lot of people don't realize how good of a shooter he is.  If he continues on his trajectory from this season he's gonna be only behind Curry in terms of all time shooter rankings.",

People ideas of players ate formed entirely by what they read here and the highlight/lowlight clips by people with an agenda\n\nSGA gets fouled a lot because he drives more than any other player in the league and plays with a herky-jerky, start-stop playstyle full of fakes and jabs that causes defenders to throw themselves at him. The refs don't secretly support a random guard from a small market team with a favorable whistle just because your team can't defend without fouling. he also averages the most PPG in the league without fouls so that says it all tbh",

We've never seen Trae get to play with a really elite Frontcourt player.  The Murray trade was such a stupid move from the beginning.  Trae never needed another ball dominate guard in the starting lineup with him.  That's why Dyson looked so good playing alongside Trae.; Dyson makes an impact without the ball.    \n  \nThe Hawks front office I think just so badly wanted Trae to be like Curry that they thought Trae and Murray would be the next Curry and Thompson, but Trae and Murray's strengths are not similar to the Curry and Thompson.  ATL should have packaged all those 1st round picks back then for an All-Star Forward/Center or just held on to them.",

Very talented players in Johnson and Kristaps who can’t stay on the floor, and a 1 time injury replacement all-star in Murray who simply never fit in. \n\nIf Trae is so bad, why does everyone expect him to simultaneously carry rosters through such shitty situations?

This is what you are trying to keep?  I kinda like the Simons expiring contract for a guy who could still theoretically have some upside, especially when playing for a competent franchise like the Celtics.  And I mean if Simons just is a good scorer during the season he's probably worth more as a trade asset before the deadline.  I'm not saying don't trade Simons, but like get something good or have some other move in mind.  I'm just not sure the point in making trades of expiring contracts to keep mediocre at best assets.\n\nOf course Brad Stevens is much smarter than me when it comes to basketball and the salary cap.",

    "selftext": "The Celtics' postseason finish was their worst since losing to the Nets in the first round in 2021.\n\nThey have an offseason full of decisions to make, including dealing with high luxury tax and Jayson Tatum's injury, which will, at minimum, keep him out for most of next season.\n\nHow much longer will the Boston Celtics title window stay open?\n\nOne encouraging sign for the Celtics was the announcement of one tenured player intending on returning for his 19th NBA season.\n\nIt was reported by Brett Siegel of Clutch Points that Horford intends to come back next season.\n\nHorford is a free agent this offseason, so a deal still has to be worked out.\n\nWith the possibility of Kristaps Porzingis being traded this offseason, having a player like Horford return will be big for a team managing their forward/center depth.\n\nLuke Kornet is also a free agent this summer, and it is uncertain if he will look to return or sign elsewhere on a bigger contract.\n\nHorford notably took a pay cut a few seasons ago in the middle of his contract to give the Celtics financial flexibility.\n\nWith likely a year or so left in his career, it wouldn't be surprising to see Horford on a cheap deal to return with the team he might retire with eventually.\n\nHorford has provided steady production and excelled in his specific role over the past few seasons.\n\nIn 24-25 as a 38-year-old he averaged 9.0 PPG, 6.2 RPG, 0.9 BPG and 1.9 3P (one of five players to have those stats in 24-25).\n\nHe was also 16th in the NBA in 24-25 with a +6.6 plus-minus on the court.\n\nSource: [https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/boston-celtics/news/celtics-al-horford-return-25-26-19th-nba-season/7b69849c0f233974cd660a76](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/boston-celtics/news/celtics-al-horford-return-25-26-19th-nba-season/7b69849c0f233974cd660a76)  \n",

In this technique, also known as the \"Kornet Contest\", Kornet jumps with both hands raised and centered over his head, no matter the distance from the shooter. The goal is to visually block the basket and distract the shooter while avoiding the possibility of a foul for contact.[20] As of December 6, 2022, opposing shooters were 5 for 18 on shot attempts against Kornet's Eclipse. While a small sample size, this conversion rate of 28% was well below the league average of 38% made on 3-point field goal attempts. \"",

Maybe some kind of 3 team trade where the Bucks can get their own pick back for next year. \n\nThe Celtics need to shed salary soon. They would have to totally blow this team up by the time Tatum is coming back and fully rebuild, this trade would allow them a couple more rides with some small retooling instead of having to restart from ground zero.\n\nThe Bucks have one down year betting on Tatum getting back to form after missing a season, pick up a decent young role player with playoff experience, and a couple picks would be huge for them considering they don't have their own first until 2030 right now.

You don't know if Tatum or Dame will fully recover - Dame is more questionable because of his age and position. \n\nBut like you note, the Bucks don't own their 2026 nor 2027 picks. New Orleans has the 2027 pick and has the 2026 swap. So probably need to pull them into the trade to get one or both of those back. Giving up the swap isn't too big of an ask because if the Bucks keep Giannis, then the Bucks are probably better than New Orleans and so the swap doesn't happen anyway. So maybe they would give up that swap for just an extra pick - like one of the Celtics picks.",

    "selftext": "People were so high on CLE, and I said they had a very very low chance of winning this year, let alone winning it all this year.   \nThe West is down to OKC-DEN, MIN-GSW  \nThe East is CLE-IND, BOS-NYK\n\nOKC will gentleman sweep Denver,   \nGSW will either win in 6 or lose in 6\n\nBOS will also most likely gentleman sweep NYK. \n\nThe most \"interesting\" series is actually CLE-IND. \n\nSo many people thought the Cavs will just be a favourite and what not... but   \nA) I never believed they would be as good their record would indicate, although they've been a great regular season team  \nB) I just have high high doubts on a team that has Donovan as their best player.   \nB2) Darius Garland is actually so much more important to their offense (CLE is 9-2 without Donovan, 4-3 without Garland\n\nC) \"Even\" (this is not a BIG even) if they make it through to the Pacers, I just don't ever see them beating BOS with two small guard line up. Such a defensive liability. \n\nIf we are in a year where Mobley was their best player (as in he's improved past Donovan) I could see Cavs being able to bring home a championship.   \nas of right now, I think they have around the same odds as GSW winning the championship  \nOut of the 8 teams remaining, it's CLEARLY BOS who are the favourites, and it's not even close. \n\nI think GSW will have a hard time making it through Minnesota, but have a higher odds of winning the championship than Minnesota.   \nOKC is the second favourite, but they're going to have a much tougher path to the finals than any team in the East. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v2t2uf1lo1ze1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=e74032b4fa5eddcf1a992e6f2662771d8a970e50\n\nGreat rotation players (Kristaps, Jrue, White, Horford, Pritchard\\*) with the occasional sprinkle of Hauser and Kornet.. this Boston team can give so many different looks and switch so well. \n\nThey're like a PROVEN OKC team.

    "selftext": "After the injury to Jayson Tatum, and the back to back salary dump trades of Jrue and Porzingis, you can't help but look at the team and wonder whether the Celtics window just closed.\n\nTitle windows in the NBA tend to be notoriously short and end unexpectedly, but it really seemed like the Celtics had a bit more of a window to try to compete.\n\nThey did a good job in getting rid of Jrue's salary, but I doubt Anfernee Simons is part of the long term plan, and was likely picked up for his expiring contract. Meanwhile, the Porzingis deal was a pure salary dump.\n\nFor their title run, the Celtics had a core 6 of Tatum, Brown, Jrue, Porzingis, White and Horford. Jrue and Porzingis are both now gone, with little return, Horford is now 39, and not realistically going to be part of their next real contender.\n\nTatum's injury also comes just as his supermax is about to kick in next season, leaving the Celtics with both him and Brown on supermaxes, taking up a combined 70% of the cap, by themselves. Tatum is worth a supermax, but while Brown had the leverage to get a supermax, but, that is certainly not a contract that will be expected to produce excess value in the foreseeable future.\n\nIn terms of other assets, Pritchard is a nice 6th man on a bargain contract, and Hauser is another solid bench piece on a reasonable deal. That having been said, I don't think anyone is expecting a team with those two in the starting lineup to be competing for titles. But, there isn't really anything else to be particularly excited about on the roster, and their draft capital is less than average (owing a swap to SAS in 2028, a pick to Portland or Washington in 2029, and owning no excess picks).\n\nTatum and Brown are locked in for the long term, so the Celtics will have the time to build around them again, but even if Tatum comes back at full strength, is there a viable path to build a title contender around those two on supermax deals in the next few years, outside of hoping to hit gold on some late draft picks?\n\n",

In that Game 4? Bron only went 8-22 and wasted 30pts-10rebs from Mozgov with a chance to go up 3-1. Curry statpadded his 26ppg average in the 4th of Game 5 (?) while the game was already out of reach. Without that barrage with the game in hand, he averages in the low 20s and his efficiency was below par. Not to mention, he had the easiest matchup on the entire court as the supposed “best player”.

    "selftext": "Let’s assume a healthy Paolo/Franz/Suggs take a positive step chemistry wise and Bane doesn’t take a step back from his career averages.\n\nIs Orlando a Contender or a Pretender in what looks like a Weak Eastern Conference?\n\nKeep in mind:\n\nCleveland will most certainly run-it-back and are probably the only sure fire contender outside of Indiana who obviously is a contender.\n\nBoston is frozen by the Tatum/Brown injury’s and a desire to Cut Salary.\n\nMilwaukee is without Lillard and stuck with a crappy roster and no flexibility to improve.\n\nKnicks fired their coach and have been rebuffed in their attempts to steal a good coach from another team. No flexibility to improve.\n\nPistons has key players hitting free agency and has a roster build problem. They have to build around Cade and that’s hard since Detroit is not a destination city in a weak Free Agent Class.\n\nNone of the Teams that ended Below .500 in the East are threat to drastically improve.\n\nWhat do you think? \n\n\n\n\n",

    "selftext": "#Coach\n\nReports are that Mike Brown and Taylor Jenkins will be the first official interviews next week for the head coaching vacancy.\n\nHard to deny the experience of Brown over Jenkins.\n\n• 50-40 playoff record\n\n• 4X NBA champion as an assistant coach\n\n• 2X COTY (23’-Kings, 09’-Cavs)\n\n• Led the 2007 Cavs to the NBA finals\n\n• Led the Cavs to the most wins in franchise history.\n\n• Led the Kings to the their first playoff berth in 17 seasons (none between 2006-2022).\n\n• Led the Cavs to their first playoff berth in 8 seasons (none between 1998-2005).\n\nBrown (55 years old) could be the answer that the Knicks have been searching for.\n\n#Roster\n\nNow that KD/Giannis have died down, what assets do the Knicks have and what do they need?\n\nBased on the Conference Finals (vs the Pacers) and 2025 NBA Finals, Knicks need more scoring/defense on the perimeter and overall depth for next season.\n\nAmongst their core rotational players, who can they trade to acquire these assets and depth?\n\nBrunson - best player on the team with the greatest contract in the NBA ($40 million per season over the next 4 years), that’s a NO.\n\nBridges and Anunoby are 2-way perimeter players, No.\n\nHart - wouldn’t have enough trade value to acquire the assets (can still provide solid production at $20 million over the next 3 years), No.\n\n#Towns\n\nKAT is an excellent offensive weapon, solid rebounder and efficient passer. But his defense is pretty atrocious at times; inability to stay out of foul trouble has plagued him most of his career.\n\nAt approximately $57 million over the next 3 seasons, that indeed is the tradable asset.\n\n#Pelicans\n\nJoe Dumars is the president of basketball operations for the Pelicans. That’s a team in search of move to make this offseason.\n\nThe Knicks could indeed use the Pels as a trading partner.\n\n#Potential Trade\n\nKNICKS RECEIVE:\n\n- Tre Murphy III\n\n- Kelly Olynk\n\n- Jose Alvarado\n\n- Yves Messi\n\n- 2027 and 2031 2nd round picks\n\n#2025-26 Lineup\n\nNow the Knicks would be solid defensively with 3 two-way 6”6 to 6”8 wing defenders in the starting lineup that can also score. Captain Brunson will continue to steer the ship offensively and Robinson can protect the rim defensively.\n\nA solid bench that features Josh Hart, Deuce McBride, veteran Kelly Olynk and New York native Jose Alvarado.\n\nCould this team, coached properly, win it all?",

Great teams can't have their two best players be defensive liabilities, especially if one of them is the center.  Towns is great, but he's a great role player, not a foundation piece for a champion.  Other GMs understand this perfectly well, so the Knicks won't get superficially equal value in a trade; it will have to be other role players that fit the Brunson-Knicks roster better. So I like your trade for the Knicks, but don't see the Pels doing something that would make them (at best) a play-in team in the West. I wish the Thunder would do something like Towns for iHart, Dort and a pick or two, but that won't happen either. Maybe a slightly better chance to get Markkanen and Kessler from the Jazz.",

    "title": "Definition of a SUPERSTAR",
    "selftext": "The term superstar has been thrown around too much in recent years.   \nI would like to see if people agree with my definition or not.   \nI am talking strictly about a SUPERSTAR PLAYER, not entertainer as recently described by Magic Johnson.   \n(however, the two can often overlap)\n\nFirst, here is what a SUPERSTAR isn't:   \n\\-Any **All-Star**  \nMost people often call any GOOD player (i.e.: Karl Anthony-Towns, Jaylen Brown, Pascal Siakam) a SUPERSTAR.   \nJust because someone is good, they cannot be a superstar, otherwise we'd have like 30 superstars in the league, meaning it would average out to each team having a superstar, when that clearly isn't the case. \n\n  \na **Superstar** should be limited to usually around 5 players in the league.  \nMeaning Top 5 players in the league. There's a few exceptions that I'll touch on.   \nBut a **Superstar** is someone who is able to carry (or at least viewed as capable of leading) a team to a championship by having an immense impact on the team and its opponents.   \nAlso, due to how the game is played, Offense > Defensive impact. However a two-way player would most definitely still be \"eligible\" for a Superstar potential. \n\nCurrently, these are the \"Top 5\" Players in the league: (\\* denotes a player who has led the team to a finals. Bold denotes a player who has won the championship as the best player)  \n**-Jokic**  \n**-Giannis**  \n\\-Shai\\*  \n\\-Luka\\*  \n**-Jayson Tatum**\n\nthe exception to the top 5 rule is someone who is also a LEGACY player. Someone who may now be playing closer to an all-star level, but has had such a successful career with multiple championships, that their legacy is solidified and forever cemented as a superstar.   \nThese would be: **LeBron James**, **Stephen Curry**, **Kevin Durant (maybe Kawhi as well, but such a short prime)**\n\nThere's argument can be made for players like Anthony Edwards, Hali (currently), Jalen Brunson, Donovan Mitchell as superstars, but quite frankly Brunson and Mitchell hasn't done enough. Donovan Mitchell is one of the most common names I see coming up for a superstar argument, but he's really never been on a bad regular season team but he's only made it to the second round twice in his career, and NEVER a conference final. Let that sink in.   \nI think ANT and Hali have both done MORE in their younger careers, hence why they're closer to being a superstar than Donovan Mitchell, and most likely Jalen Brunson as well. \n\nSomeone did bring up the fact that the market that one plays in could play an impact, but I am disregarding the market size or the \"entertainment\" factor. \n\nWe have guys calling Lamelo a superstar, and it gives me the biggest frown. It's just disgusting to call just anyone a superstar.   \nI think Ja Morant had superstar potential when he was showing early and high levels of success paired with his style of play, but last two years have been more than underwhelming coming from the Grizzlies. \n\n",

    "selftext": "Tatum down, and the Achilles injury keeps him there for anywhere from .5-1.5 seasons depending on how cautious they are with recovery. \n\nThe team around Tatum is aging up pretty quickly, Jrue, White, horford, porzingis, all at least on the declining side of their careers at that point of the recovery. When Tatum returns, the only big pieces that they can really plan around for the future would be brown, Tatum, and Pritchard. That said, it’s very likely that Tatum is not a full version of himself when he returns. \n\nThis doesn’t even mention that they are definitely moving somebody to get out of the 2nd apron this offseason, and maybe a couple guys in order to fully get out of the tax, leaving them in a spot where, even if Tatum returns and is the exact same player, they are likely to look more like a playoff competitor, but not a true title contender (unless they make some key FA/trade moves).\n\nMy thing here: how crazy is it to just blow this up entirely and sell high on the whole roster? You can set yourself up with a war chest of assets that rivals or even beats OKC’s, and go into the future with a construction built entirely around young talent, adding some key veterans along the way. \n\nIs that totally insane? I feel like that’s at least a meeting that gets a couple hours of play in that FO, because they could get some serious return on the team they have and just ransack upcoming drafts, probably hit a pretty quick reset like that if their scouting department does their thing and gets value players.

At that point, you likely are either off of KP and horford/are seeing a diminished return from their contributions, you have already previously moved somebody combination of White, jrue/hauser, or any other members of the roster. \n\nWithout getting very lucky in draft, or hitting a big name in the FA market, how competitive is that team? I’d say winning a first round series at best, and play-in/first round exit is most likely outcome. Without competitive play at the center position they’d look a lot like the lakers, and without jrue or white they’d have a much less intimidating defense. \n\nSo is it worth it to run it back, stay in the tax and still get repeater penalties, for a quick loss in the playoffs? Or would it be better for the owners to sell all, get that war chest, and build a bright future? \n\nI just can’t see this team being seriously competitive upon Tatums return with the rest of their roster aging out, without drawing some great FAs or selling out their future to trade for a big star, which I always question the wisdom of personally.",

    "selftext": "Michael Jordan. Tim Duncan. Magic Johnson. Kobe Bryant. Only four players in league history with five Finals wins and two Finals MVPs.\n\nI’ve been thinking about where Kobe Bryant lands in the all-time rankings, and for me, he’s on my second All-NBA team. Some people might not get that, but here’s why.\n\nKobe wasn’t the freak athlete LeBron is. LeBron is 6’9”, 250 pounds of pure basketball cheat code. He could put up 27/7/7 without even trying. Kobe had to grind for everything. He put up a career 25/5/5 and made it happen every single night. That’s impressive. He made it work, and he won plenty along the way.\n\nYeah, he wasn’t the most efficient scorer by the numbers. I get that. But it didn’t matter. He played in an era loaded with iso scorers like Melo, AI, T-Mac, Vince Carter, but Kobe was the best of that bunch and it’s not close. And when it came to big games, Kobe delivered: 81 points, 62 in three quarters, Game 4 of the 2000 Finals, the 2006 run where he dragged Smush Parker and Kwame Brown to the playoffs, Game 7 in 2010. Those are moments that some players might have once or twice in a career. Kobe had them on speed dial.\n\nAbout the 3-peat: yeah, that was Shaq’s team, no question. Even Kobe would say that. But let’s be real, Shaq wasn’t winning three in a row without Kobe. It was Shaq and Kobe, not Shaq and the Lakers. He needed him. That was a duo that worked.\n\nKobe’s greatness is that he took the talent he had and maximized it. He didn’t coast on raw athleticism. He worked harder than anyone and he delivered time and time again. Ultimate winner. He brought himself to these conversations. ",

        "body": "First of all, you left off KAB so you’re starting from a wrong premise. And by the token Bill Russell who the award is named after assuredly passes your test. \n\nSecond the metrics is kinda random. Is Bron worse than Kobe because he doesn’t have 5 rings? If Shaq got one more ring when he was touring the US tryna ring chase would that make him better? \n\nKobe is amazing because players and fans feared him. He didn’t let pressure get to him, maybe thrived off it, and he had another gear that felt like out of a video game where he would go Wolverine mode and no one could stop him. \n\nThe negative of Kobe is he was objectively a ball hog with many times bad decision making. He was also a very shitty teammate for most of his career.\n\nPeople who didn’t watch prime Kobe are just as biased as people who did. Neither is objectively a better opinion. Basketball is entertainment and Kobe was a beloved entertainer and that’s why many people remember him. His legacy doesn’t hold up as well under scrutiny because he had bad efficiency and probably cost the lakers their fourth chip against Detroit\n\nI’d say most lists have Kobe just outside the top 10, with maybe about a third of them having him in the 8-10 slot. Of note, Kobe’s peers consistently rank him very highly which is not meaningless. \n\nUltimately though you’re providing a subjective opinion to counter subjective opinions and none of it is more true than any others",

    "selftext": "I'm not saying the stats are everything. Particularly the ones readily calculable in small sample sizes ([Boxscore Plus-Minus](https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/bpm.html) and [Win Shares](https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/ws.html)) can be misleading. But I do think it is interesting to note:\n\n**2022: Jimmy Butler (+10.2 BPM, 1.4 WS) over Jayson Tatum (+5.5 BPM, 0.9 WS)**\n\nFull disclosure: I don't believe losing the series should bar you from winning Finals MVP. I even more strongly believe that to be the case for the conference finals. The Jerry West precedent is clear: lose in a tight game 7 as by far the best player in the series and you can still take home the trophy.\n\n**2023: Caleb Martin (+6.6 BPM, 1.3 WS) over Jimmy Butler (+5.2 BPM, 0.9 WS)**\n\nMartin did receive 4/9 votes, so not that controversial. Would have surpassed Andre Iguodala\\* and Cedric Maxwell for biggest surprise win ever if he'd pulled it off.\n\n*\\*who had the same WS as LeBron and a higher BPM than Curry, by the by.*\n\n**2024: Derrick White (+6.6 BPM, 0.7 WS) over Jaylen Brown & Jayson Tatum (+1.8/+1.7 BPM, 0.5 WS)**\n\nThis will be sure to infuriate both sides of the tiresome debate over Jaylen v Tatum, who split the votes 5-4. Personally I'd have voted for Jrue (+5.3 BPM, 0.7 WS).  ¯\\\\\\_(ツ)\\_/¯\n\n**2025: Tyrese Haliburton (+7.6 BPM, 1.0 WS) over Pascal Siakam (+4.6 BPM, 0.8 WS)**\n\nFinally and most topically, yet another 5-4 split decision. This strikes me as eerily similar to Magic v Worthy in 1988, with the bigger closeout game trumping the (imo) superior series.\n\nAs I said, advanced stats aren't the be-all end-all. Specifically they can get a little hazy on defence. But they're 4/4 on WCFMVPs winners and do a pretty good job on FMVPs, so to that end I've put [a list dating back to 1985](https://www.reddit.com/r/VintageNBA/comments/1kr2jan/conference_fmvps_by_box_plusminus_19852003/) on r/VintageNBA. (In keeping with the spirit of this award, McHale beats Bird for one).",

    "selftext": "I spent close to 12 years lifting 6 days a week, hyper focusing on calories, nutrition, supplements and hydration to reach my own genetic limits. After about 5 years I was concerned that despite doing everything as perfect as I could, I was always fatigued, low on libido, and not gaining the way I should. Did blood work realized I had an endocrine dysfunction and began TRT at 26. And let me tell you, that shit WORKS. I wasn’t even blasting cycle levels, just bringing my T up to the high end of normal for my age, and managing estrogen and SHBH, and my energy and gains shot through the roof.\n\nWhen I look at before and after pictures of Giannis and consider the timeline. Even with nutritionists, trainers and complete dedication, what he achieved and maintained doesn’t seem feasible for even the most genetically gifted humans. Especially when you consider his was so malnourished and had liver dysfunction, it’s almost guaranteed he was having hormonal imbalances and endocrine issues given his size, activity level, and lack of nutrition.\n\nTo me it’s almost a guarantee that at least for a time, he was put on some form of anabolic protocol. I’m NOT saying he was taking tren, synthol, or any of that shit, but when you look at his frame and current physique is shows all the hallmarks of testosterone use, particularly in the shoulders. His gut also looks like that of someone using a therapeutic dose of HGH.\n\n\nCurious if people generally and widely believe he achieved all this with chicken, brown rice and hard work. Seems rather obvious to me he had help to go with what was no doubt insanely hard work.\n\nBut I think because he’s the lovable goofball and such a feel good inspirational story, people want to convince themselves he would never do something like that.",

They’re freaks of nature. Saquan Barkley sqauts 600 pounds and runs a 4.4 s 40 yard dash. He gets tested for PEDs and has never been positive. Look at LeBron James. He is 40 and is still a freak of nature. He’s never been positive for PEDs in his 22 year career. \n\nThink about your training and diet regimen, and it’s not even close to how detailed and strict those guys are. Their entire life, entire career, is dedicated to their bodies. Not to mention they’re just genetically superior to you and me when it comes to athletics. Even if we trained and dieted as hard as they do, we could probably never reach their levels of fitness and athleticism. \n\nI would really rethink the TRT. Your body is becoming reliant on it and will stop producing any T on its own. You’re essentially going to become dependent on it for the rest of your life, and you’re young.",

    "selftext": "Thank GOD that the Knicks won. I'll have to admit that I was wrong about Brunson (he's better than Melo ever was for the Knicks), hats off to them. But Boston just didn't feel like the same team, or were they ever that team in the first place? Celtics had an easy road to the playoffs last year, don't make that argument of \"You play whoever is in front of you.\" If that's the case then surely Celtics are gonna make an excuse for Tatum's injury right? Horford and Jrue are old, KP plays like a door dasher, and Brown can't stop fouling. No way in HELL were they repeating.\n\nCall me crazy, but don't be surprised if Joe Mazzuella gets fired (look at the Bucks and Nuggets). Celtics gotta let some guys go, they CANNOT pay all of them. Tatum isn't gonna play at all next year. It's gonna be basically Jaylen Brown by himself next year. This'll be the last time I'll mention anything Boston or Tatum related for the whole year. Thankfully, I won't have to hear anything from racist Celtics fans for a long time. Congrats New York! Thoughts???",

And in that stretch, the two players above will be the core.\n\nTake Note, both are still in rookie contracts for the next 2-3 years. \n\nNow, once they are developed, maybe they can let older guys go like Russ, MPJ, etc.\n\nThe Nuggets drafted 20+ yrs old draft prospects in 2022 and 2023. And it worked since they are in contending phase. So, it makes more sense to draft nba ready players even if they are older. \n\nThe Nuggets lost Bruce Brown and KCP from the Champion Nuggets Team. \n\nLet's see how Christian and Julian can develop. Will they be better than MPJ? Let's wait and see.\n\nWhat do you think of the two? Especially nuggets fans?\n\nPS:\n\nPacers technically drafted Julian, but they just did in favor of Nuggets. And then Julian is traded right away to Nuggets. So, Nuggets is really the one who wanted Julian.",

In games 1 and 2 of this series, his players (who are statistically amongst the best three point shooters in NBA history) inexplicably missed a huge amount of open threes. To put it differently, the coach got them into a position to shoot a bunch of open shots. They went on a prolonged cold streak in both games. Not Joe’s fault, not the Knicks’ doing. Make or miss league. And they needed to make exactly one more open shot to win either or both of those games. They didn’t. Blaming the coach is absurd.",

    "selftext": "Hey r/NBATalk — I’ve been deep-diving into the 1988 Olympic cycle and I’ve got a fun “What if?” scenario I’d love your help with.\n\nWe all know the 1988 U.S. Olympic team, made up of college amateurs, came up short with a bronze — pushing FIBA and USA Basketball toward the eventual rule change that led to the iconic 1992 Dream Team.\n\nBut what if that change came earlier?\n\nLet’s say USA Basketball saw the writing on the wall before the Seoul Games and quietly assembled a pro-based team — a “Dream Team Zero,” if you will. Using what we know from the exhibition games vs. the NBA All-Star Select squad and the 1988 NBA landscape, I compiled a pool of 23 legitimate candidates who could’ve plausibly been invited to camp.\n\nNow I need your help: Who do we cut to get to a final 12-man roster?\n\nHere’s the full 23-man pool, broken down by position:\n\nCenters: Brad Daugherty, Patrick Ewing, Moses Malone, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, David Robinson (college grad)\n\nPower Forwards: Kevin Willis (also plays center), Buck Williams, Charles Barkley (can also play SF), Kevin McHale, Karl Malone, Danny Manning (college grad, also can play SF)\n\nSmall Forwards: Larry Bird (can also play PF), Dominique Wilkins, Mark Aguirre, James Worthy\n\nShooting Guards: Danny Ainge (can also play PG), Michael Jordan, Clyde Drexler, Joe Dumars\n\nPoint Guards: Terry Porter, John Stockton, Magic Johnson (can also play SG), Isiah Thomas\n\nA few notes. Robinson and Manning are the two “amateurs” I included, since they were clearly on the Olympic team and already NBA-bound. This roster includes a blend of players at or near their prime (MJ, Isiah, Dominique) and legends who were still elite in ’88 (Magic, Bird). Depth is crazy at every spot, and certain guys like Barkley, Magic, and Bird give us serious positional flexibility.\n\nSo here’s where I need the hive mind: Who are the 11 cuts? Who makes the final 12?\n\nBuild me the ultimate alternate-reality 1988 Dream Team — the one that could’ve run the table four years before Barcelona.\n\nWould love to hear your takes.",

Great numbers but nothing historic.\n\nBut look at his teammates. It is astounding how so many of them played way beyond their norm. It doesn’t make sense really.\n\nWiggins. Played absolutely crazy in the playoffs. Not only was he scoring an efficient 17 per night but he was grabbing almost 8 rebounds a game and playing elite defense. He has NEVER played like this before or again. It was almost like he was possessed by a person with a much higher desire to win. If Wiggins plays like Wiggins the Warriors lose. This is one of the biggest outlier series for a player ever. Never before have I seen a lukewarm player with a low motor turn in up 10 notches and play out of his mind.\n\nJordan Poole. Another WTF playoff run. The guy looked like a legit #1 option for extended minutes in the playoffs. Guy averaged 22 points per 36. Which amazing for your 4th option. But more crazy was his efficiency. Guy was at 50/39/90 shooting splits on 65.4% TS. That is KD efficiency from a perimeter player. Again if Jordan plays his normal level the Warriors lose.\n\nEven a guy like Otto Porter dropping 63% TS and knocking down multiple big 3s. This is literally the last time he was an effective player and he went out with a bang.\n\nAs a team they shot a scorching 59% TS for the entire playoffs.\n\nIn my entire life I have never seen so many role players perform so much better than their norm. Guys like Poole and Wiggins have never ever reached close to those heights again. ",

Crazy thing too was Steph, Klay and Draymond didn't really all play together at the same time until the playoffs as they each went through their own injuries. The role guys you mentioned were all great, Looney too was a rebounding machine and GP2 became a key lockdown defender. Speaking of which, yes the offense was great from Curry and Poole in particular but during that run their defense was pretty historically great.",

Jokic absolutely went bananas after that.\n\nVs Memphis\nOf all the series this was the most contentious and satisfying. When Brooks clotheslined GP2 this series got incredibly tense. But it was the close out game where Looney had 22 rebounds.\n\nVs Dallas\nWiggins played incredible in this series, thank you Dallas for being Phoenix the previous round.\n\nVs Boston \nPoole hitting 2 3 pointers at the end of the third quarter was great. Curry having an epic Game 4 in Boston to tie the series.\nHowever Game 6 with the 21-0 run in the first half, Curry doing the night night in the 3rd quarter. However my favorite moment from Game 6 was some rebound Boston could have easily gotten but they just were tapped out and didn't bother to hustle   with 1:51 to go. That was the victory cigar and winning in Boston made it even cooler.\n\nJust a fun a random group of players.\nI'd love to see a matchup between the 2022 Warriors vs 2011 Mavericks ",

Making the path quite easy, relatively speaking.\n\nGSW had to beat Denver, Memphis, Mavs to get to the finals. \n\nBoth Murray and MPJ missed the series so it just Jokic doing his best, alone.\n\nThen they had to face Memphis, led by very young Ja, JJ and Bane. While Morant was playing amazing, he got injured and missed the remaining 3 games in the series.\n\nIn WCF, they had Dallas to beat which had a terrible roster. Luka carried them there, Brunson and Dinwiddie were playing well too. But as a team, they had no business going that far if not for Luka's heroics, not to mention Luka himself was 22 years old at the time.\n\nFinally, we get to the Finals. Yet another young team, Boston Celtics. This was no Boston we saw in 2024. Tatum was still young, Smart was downright hurting the team offensively. This was the Celtics that were really struggling and usually losing to Miami Heat.\n\nOf course GSW winning against these teams was far from being a miracle. You've got Steph Curry, who was a superstar still close to his prime. Klay's defense after injury declined but he was still Klay on the offensive end. Dray had one of his best seasons himself.\n\nOn top of their core 3, this was quite a deep roster. Talented players like Wiggins and Poole made great use of GSW's spacing and ball movement. This helped Otto as a shooter as well. Then there were solid defenders like Payton and Looney. \n\nAs a highly experienced, deep, talented team facing one of the easiest paths to an NBA title, I don't get why it was so surprising for them to win.",

A player said they used to do 1 test a year, at the same time every year so you could cycle off it easily to appear clean, which explains why there were less injuries and how more players could play more games. Although this wouldn’t be exclusive to the NBA, it was widespread in sports in the 80s and 90s.\n\nThat said 1 clip doesn’t really prove anything. Magic Johnson is a highlight reel, you could easily find plenty. What is a fact, however, is they were less skilled back then and that is normal for sports evolving. Do people really believe basketball players peaked in the 80s and 90s? Like in 85 Magic was the highest paid player getting $2.5m a year, that is equivalent to just under $7.5m today. And just over half what the average NBA player makes. Now more than ever there’s a bigger incentive for players to improve, they have more to work with and learn from. The talent gap is much closer today than the past.",

He’s THAT good. But Denver clearly lacked options in game 7, and it just looked like they gave up down the stretch. Not having a bench does that to any team. \n\nMPJ will fetch them a couple of picks, or some good rotational pieces. I could see Miami or Detroit making a move for him, as they need a real option at the PF. Miami especially, as I would be willing to bet Duncan Robinson gets moved in that deal. Porter could easily slide in Miami’s starting lineup and be good too. ",

I think Braun and a FRP would get the most value but you’re going full win now mode.  Braun looks like a winning player. Strawther has shown some flashes and could optimistically be close to starting caliber with some heavy off-season work. That could open a realistic small ball rotation with Gordon at center.  \nA lot of guys on that team are not quite in their prime yet, there should be improvements next year.  Not throwing shade, but OKC is a bunch of guys that other teams passed on.  The nuggets should improve next year regardless.",

If you can get 3-4 guys like Braun around Jokic, you get a very solid team in 2-3 years. Don’t think current roster can win more than a few series without depth and more energy.",

    "selftext": "It's been sad watching the teams with two of the best of their era in Giannis and Jokic come to an end like this. Bucks have no draft picks for six years, Dame will likely be out for the season, Kyle Kuzma is still sucking air on that team as the 3rd option, and it's highly possible Giannis might leave to start a rebuild. Nuggets have completely peaked, Michael Porter Jr. has declined significantly, Jamal Murray is still somewhat inconsistent as the 2nd option, their bench is atrocious, they need to find a new coach, and since they're well above the 2nd apron with a massively high payroll, they can't be as flexible with trades or signings. \n\nI'm biased as a Bucks fan, but even I think Milwaukee can salvage something out of this. Giannis is going to get a haul of picks if he asks out or better yet, a year to just reset and go again when Dame gets healthier. They're also not a second apron team so they can find some flexibility with making marginal adjustments for the future. Denver has just utterly failed to maximize Jokic with any real help and it doesn't seem to be getting better. All my opinion though. \n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/1kpwdyf)",

Not only was Mike Malone given a pink slip but the GM he so often clashed with was fired alongside him for what felt like the first steps of a significant shapeup in the offseason.  \n\nNow?  The Nuggets are one game away from their 3rd Conference Finals appearance in the past 5 seasons (Bubble year & 2023 when they won were the two prior appearances).  How much one wants to credit interim coach David Adelman for his coaching decisions or Jokic for being Jokic for this postseason is up to you but the 180 on defense alone is quite the paradigm shift - and this isn't even to account for the fact that Michael Porter Jr. isn't even fully healthy at the moment.\n\nIf the OKC Thunder - who are perceived to have one of the better coaches in the league via Mark Daigneault - lose at home then it will be a historic upset in the best and worst ways possible.\n\nDenver will see OKC for a \"win or go home\" Game 7.

    "selftext": ">For the Cavaliers, the Ball acquisition provides a fast-paced, defensive-minded point guard with size at 6-foot-6 as the franchise prepares to potentially lose Ty Jerome to another team in free agency. As the Cavaliers enter the 2025-26 season approximately $12 million over the salary cap's second apron -- and with All-Star and Defensive Player of the Year Evan Mobley receiving a $45 million bonus on his rookie maximum contract -- it makes Ball's contract at two years and $20 million, with a team option on 2026-27, more palatable. Cavaliers president of basketball operations Koby Altman and his staff have targeted Ball for months, inquiring about him at the February trade deadline and then ultimately finalizing the deal Saturday.\n\nSource:https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/45603177/sources-bulls-trading-lonzo-ball-cavaliers-isaac-okoro",

I mean both teams aren’t getting any value. Bulls and Cavs fans, Just shakes hands and walk away.\n\n\nPSA :Edit!!(Awesome response!!! ) the real question is this trade for both won’t help the bulls get into playoff contention or help the Cavs move deeper in the post. Ty Jerome as many have talked about out still doesn’t solve the Cavs going deeper. It’s either the core stick together and find that missing “key” or the Cavs organization blows it up. As for the bulls, semi-rebuild. I honestly think Giddy isn’t what yall bulls fans need. BUT, he will do for now to make it to the playoffs. Bulls go deeper in the post??? Not with the current roster. Pacers taking OKC the game 7 kind of made it ok that the Cavs lost to them. When the Cavs got knocked out, I was thinking drop DG and J.Allen. BUT with Pacers doing what they did. I’m not saying it’s DG and Allen fault. They are realistic pieces that have value to push the Cavs to the next level.",

        "body": "TLDR: The Cavs can offer an amount that may actually be slightly higher than the MLE. They want to pay less because team salary is so high. But it is going to require actual cap space for a team to be able to pay more than the Cavs.\n\nCavs don't have access to the full MLE as a tax team, but they do have Jerome's early bird rights because he has been with the team for two years. This allows for paying a starting salary that is either 175% of the previous year's salary (irrelevant here since Jerome only made $2.5M this year) or 105% of the previous year's average salary. The NBA average salary is calculated in such a way that it's actually a bit larger than the $11.9M you'll see if you google this year's average salary (I'll explain how below for those interested). This means that (by design) 105% of average salary is extremely similar to the full MLE. The exact figure for average salary won't be known until determined by the July audit, but Bobby Marks estimated the Cavs can pay Jerome a starting salary of $14.3M, which is actually a bit more than the MLE, which is projected to be $14.1M. Additionally, early bird rights allow for 8% raises where the MLE only allows for 5% raises. So, MLE teams aren't a threat to outbid the Cavs on him. And because his value really isn't any more than that (thanks, Pacers), it's pretty unlikely any of the cap teams try and steal him. The Cavs are simply trying to keep costs down because they have three $40M a year contracts and need to save wherever they can. It's virtually guaranteed they'll be in the second apron this upcoming year if they retain Merrill or Jerome (or even just one of them in all likelihood). \n\n(League average salary is not determined by simply adding up total salaries and dividing by the total number of players. Total salary is totaled, including stuff like 2-ways and injury exception payments. But that number is divided by the number of teams times 13.2. 30 x 13.2 = 392. So, despite the fact that north of 500 players play in the league every year, ALL salaries are being divided by only 392 to determine the average per the CBA. I couldn't make the pieces add up on people saying the Cavs can offer him just over $14M a year because the actual average salary (rather than the CBA's average salary) is only $11.9M and $105% of that is like $12.5M. This is what I was missing.\n\nThis site has a link to the current CBA: [https://nbpa.com/cba](https://nbpa.com/cba)\n\nFor those interested, early bird rights are handled on page 232 (referred to as an \"early qualifying veteran free agent\") and average player salary is defined on page 1.)",

Will Kyrie Irving's Number \"2\" jersey will be retired too? I am curious bout your takes for this case, but I will drop mine here. Since Ty Jerome currently wears that same jersey number Kyrie did, what would the Cavs management do to this? I believe, the obvious is they either won't do it: meaning Ty Jerome would still wear the same number. Or, they would make Ty Jerome change his jersey number to another jersey number. On the other hand, Collin Sexton has also wore \"2\" when he was drafted in 2018. This was in response to the horrible manner of Kyrie leaving Cleveland.\n\nWhat is your takeaway. Drop it down there below.",

        "body": "Detroit needs to focus signing guys to tradable contracts. Get a bunch of young role players who have real development potential and can be put on 3 year/$45M contracts. Doesn't even matter if they were on the team last year. For a young team w/ a lot of cap space like Detroit, you want to fill as much space under the apron signing this type of high upside roll player on tradable contracts.\n\nUnless Ron Holland really takes a step next year, I could see Detroit trading for a star SF to replace Tobias Harris. But they need the salary to match it. And in general, the trade flexibility is great to have: either the high-upside guys they sign will fill out an important role for Detroit OR they'll become pieces in a future trade.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\nIn a lot of ways, Detroit is like the Pacers but 1 or 2 years behind in development. The Pacers were able to trade for Siakam in the middle of 2023-2024, then put a bunch of guys on tradable contracts so they could trade for another piece if they need to. So now the Pacers have a solid roster that they can just keep building upon, but they also have the flexibility to get another star by trading guys like Toppin, TJ, Nesmith, and Nembhard. I doubt that Nesmith & Nembhard would get traded at this point because they've outplayed their contracts, but some talking heads were bashing them as \"overpaid\" when they were originally resigned.",

    "selftext": "I think there is so much discourse, hand waiving, shouting, downvoting and attacking about individual player ratings or rankings, but theres almost no discourse about actual teams. OKC's *team* defense this year was a total buzzsaw and while Chet was a very good rim protector at times, he's not exactly Tim Duncan, Bill Russell or Ben Wallace in terms of a lockdown defensive anchor. I thought it would be interesting to see how this year's thunder stacked up against the best defenses historically. \n\n  \nHow do we compare the 93 knicks to the 2014 spurs to the 2025 thunder? Well, I looked at regular season defense vs the league average of that year for a regular season performance and the post season defense on a per series basis vs that opponents regular season offense. So for example, if team A plays Team Z and Team Z's regular season offense was 100 pts/100 poss and during their playoff series team Z has an offensive rating of 92.2, then team A had a -7.8 rDrtg for that series. If the team went to the finals, lets say, then you simply average the 4 series. So -7.8, -2.2, -7, +1 would average to -4, which is an excellent post season defense, just not historic. Since the playoffs are much smaller sample sizes and can be quite volatile, especially in the first round/1 vs 8 matchups, I decided to only consider teams that made it to at least round 3. I also don't have any data for Russell's Celtics as series Ortg isnt something we have and they usually only played 2 rounds anyways. I weighed regular season and post season defense equally, but I'll give both separately so you can do whatever mental curve you like. The first table is just the numbers.

The insane thing is OKC scored more points this season than any team in NBA history. I know part of that is because they made it to the in-season tourney championship and went 7 twice in the playoffs, but it’s kinda crazy that they scored that much while being that discombobulated in a lot of cases offensively. They’ll be gettable next year too if they don’t improve on that end, but if they can find consistent outside shooting and Chet can get better inside, they’ll be a whole lot better next year as a team than they were this year.

    "title": "The Timberwolves future relies on Rob Dillingham - or replacing Mike Conley via trade.  This series demonstrated their need for a reliable floor general.",
    "selftext": "So the Timberwolves lost, well all know that.  And if you didn't then, well, now you know!  It ended more or less at half when they only scored 32 points.\n\nThe big talking point of this series has been the turnovers which, aside from Game 3, were a consistent issue.  Part of that is due to OKC being a historic defense, part of that is the Timberwolves having a gaping hole in their rotation.  More specifically, them lacking a floor general to help steady the offense and orchestrate it.\n\nDespite Ant making a leap as a playmaker, he is not a natural PG nor a shoot-first floor general, he is a SG with some playmaking chops.  Given his youth, it's not impossible for him to continue making improvements as a secondary playmaker for the Timberwolves but it's not a guarantee and it's very unlikely he'll become the Timberwolves starting point guard setting the table for his teammates.\n\nMore concerning is the decline in play from Mike Conley who simply cannot be relied upon as a team's starting PG.  He averaged sub-35 from the field and from 3 the entire playoffs and due to age, he wasn't able to play as many minutes as one would like.  Additionally, Mike only has one year left on his contract so even if one assumes he won't retire, there is nothing to prevent him from potentially walking in free agency.  In either case, he needs to be replaced.\n\nThe silver lining is that the Timberwolves have two options to address their PG problem, be it relying on their rookie PG Rob Dillingham or trading Mike Conley, potentially including the now-conveying Pistons 1st in this year's draft (17th in this year's draft) along with the 31st pick in the draft aka. the 1st pick in the 2nd round.\n\n* Rob Dillingham:  In case you were wondering how the Timberwolves 2031 1st is owned by the Kings, them trading to draft Rob is why as this pick was originally owned by the Spurs who acquired it on draft night 2024.  Rob didn't get a ton of burn in the postseason and his rookie season was up and down overall but given how much they invested in getting him, it's fair to assume the plan of succession is for Dillingham to eventually succeed Mike Conley.  How soon that is remains unclear - and it's equally unclear whether he'll be able to do that.\n* Trading Mike Conley for a stopgap PG:  With Conley expiring next year, him being traded has a more likely chance of happening than one might expect.  Who exactly they would target is up in the air - it's possible they value Conley's leadership/mentoring Rob for one more year along with that 1st rounder more than they do getting...Tre Jones? - plus it may be better to use what assets they have at their disposal for a 2nd star a la Kevin Durant after Julius Randle significantly boosted his trade value.  Still, it's another option for a team that has more flexibility to make a move than one might expect on draft night, especially if they would prefer to keep Randle...or if Julius blows up any such plans by declining his player option and thus makes himself unable to be traded due to the first/second apron's rules around sign and trades.",

Was between two teams that made some big trades between each other before the season. Started the greatest dynasty in NA professional sports history and ended with the coach of the Hawks subbing himself in to make a full court pass off the backboard into the hands of their star player, which he actually did, only for said player to then miss the bunny at the last second that would have tied the game yet again. \n\nThat player, Bob Pettit, is still alive today at 92 and went on to have 50 in a Finals clincher the following year handing Russell his only finals loss (out of 12 appearances) so can’t be too harsh on him.\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention Red Auerbach punching the opposing team owner in the face before Game 3 because he accused Red of lowering the basket below regulation height.",

We got through it, everyone.\n\nThe horror of the 2024 NBA Draft is in your rearview mirror. Relax.\n\nOf course, it wasn’t as bad as everyone said it would be. If there weren’t any no-brainer superstars in last year’s class, there were, as there are every year in every draft, a couple of surprise standouts (Jared McCain, Jaylen Wells), a few pretty good contributors (Stephon Castle, Zach Edey, Zaccharie Risacher, Alexandre Sarr) and some who flashed in fits and starts (Matas Buzelis, Donovan Clingan, Kel’el Ware, Yves Missi, Dalton Knecht, Ryan Dunn). And someone from among Reed Sheppard, Ron Holland, Rob Dillingham or Nikola Topić is likely to earn a rotational role on their respective teams next season.\n\nBut all of those folks, of course, will be overshadowed by the dawning of the Cooper Flagg era in the Association. The all-but-consensus National Player of the Year led Duke to the Final Four, lived up to all the hype and will be the first pick next Wednesday, to the Dallas Mavericks, who somehow overcame insanely steep odds to get the No. 1 pick. There isn’t another player on the board like Flagg. But this year’s draft features multiple prospects who’d likely have been at or near the top of last year’s draft boards. It’s not the best draft ever, but it’s likely to produce more impact players than last season.\n\nSo, it’s NBA Draft Confidential time.\n\n[Read for free here.](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6429478/2025/06/18/nba-draft-confidential-guard-2025/)",

Player who was thought to take over the decade got one ring in Milwaukee early in the decade and might be traded ( Giannis and Kareem )\n2. Great passing big man won MVP and Title out west ( Jokic and Walton )\n3. Most dominant player of the past generation goes to the lakers and gets one ring ( Lebron and Wilt )\n4. My Knicks have a top 5 PG and top 5 C and are competing ( Frazier & Reed and Brunson & KAT )\n5. We have not had a single repeat champion ( same as 1970s )\n6. We have no definitive face of the league like the 1970s or definitive team of the decade either \n7. Seattle was led by a tall defensive guard the same as OKC ( Shai and Dennis Johnson ) shai is much more talented but a similar build just a better scorer\n\nLet me know what yall think ! 7 is my biggest stretch in my opinion but I think I’m close on some of these would love to discuss with everyone \n",

    "selftext": "Willis Reed, 2x NBA Champion, 2x Finals MVP and 1970 Season MVP does not appear among the greatest 50 players of all time in the different lists or sports chains. Willis’ disadvantage is his lack of longevity and that he was All-Star/All-NBA many fewer times than them. This is fair and necessary to know when talking about Kawhi Leonard or Nikola Jokić, who have the accolades and averages, but are short in All-Star/All-NBA due to lack of longevity or few elite seasons.\n\nTwo questions: \n1. Willis Reed must be best knickerbocker of all-time?\n2. Is Willis Reed top 50 on your list?",
